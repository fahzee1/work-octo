    <p>This code number should be a secret, 4-digit ID Code known only by you.  It is recommended that other users have a different Access ID Code.  This is covered in the section "Creating Additional Access Codes for Other Users."</p>
    
    <p>To program your new master code:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Open the Command Station cover by depressing the tab on the top.  The Command Station will say, "Use numbered keys to enter 4-digit ID."</li>
        <li>Enter your temporary 4-digit ID code (1234) using the RED numbered keys.  The Command Station will say, "Please select from start menu."</li>
        <li>Press Add button.  The Command Station will say, "Select from main menu."</li>
        <li>Press the Access Code button one time.  The Command Station will say, "Master Code, press again for next Access Code or Done to select."</li>
        <li>Press the Done button.  The Command Station will say, "Use numbered keys to enter 4-Digit Master Code."</li>
        <li>Enter your new Master Code.  The Command Station will repeat the new Master Code.  Close the panel cover.</li>

    <h2>False Alarm Prevention</h2>
    <h3>What is a false alarm?</h3>
    <p>A false alarm is defined as any signal that elicits a response by police, fire or emergency medical services for which there is no evidence of criminal activity, fire, or medical need to justify an emergency response.  This simply means that if emergency personnel respond to an alarm activation and, after investigation, find no evidence that criminal, fire, or medical activity either had occurred or was occurring, the emergency response personnel will designate the alarm signal as a false alarm.</p>
    <p>With an estimated 25% yearly increase in alarm systems nationwide, emergency responders are becoming overwhelmed with false alarms.  This is resulting in stricter ordinances, severe fines and limited or no response policies.</p>
    <p>Help us reduce false alarms through the proper use and maintenance of your alarm system and <a href="{% url operation %}#test-system" title="How to test my GE Wireless Home Security System">Monthly Testing</a>.</p>
    <p>Your alarm has been programmed with a 60-second alarm cancel code.  If you activate your alarm but disarm it with your code within 60 seconds of the activation the monitoring station will be notified that an authorized user has disarmed the system.  The activity will be logged but no further action required.</p>
    <h3>Major causes of false alarms are:</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>User error.</li>
        <li>Unlocked or loose doors.</li>
        <li>Kids, neighbors, visitors, repairmen.</li>
        <li>Cleaning crews.</li>
        <li>Pets.</li>
        <li>Equipment malfunction.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Before you activate your alarm system:</h3>
    <p>Anyone who uses the security system needs to be fully educated on its proper operation.  This may include children, neighbors, domestics, cleaning crews, caretakers, realtors, employees, and temporary staff.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure you securely close and lock all protected doors and windows.</li>
        <li>If you are leaving your home or business makes sure the door you leave by is closed tightly.</li>
        <li>Keep pets, balloons, fans, heaters, plants, etc. away from <a href="{% url sensors %}#motion-detector" title="Click to learn about our Motion Detectors">motion sensor</a> areas.</li>
        <li>Know and rehearse the process to cancel an accidental alarm.  Anyone with you key should know this process.</li>
        <li>Know how much time you have after you arm your system to leave and to disarm your system when you enter.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>False Alarm prevention with people:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Train your emergency contacts with keys on complete system operation.</li>
        <li>Instruct domestic or repair person on how to fully operate your system.</li>
        <li>Use deadbolt locks.</li>
        <li>Expand your protection with an alert neighborhood watch program.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Avoid conditions that can trigger your alarm:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tighten loose fitting <a href="{% url door-window-sensor %}" title="Learn More about our Door / Window Sensors">doors or windows (sensors)</a>.</li>
        <li>Keep doors and windows locked when the alarm is "ON" to reduce the chance that friends, neighbors or customers can enter and activate the alarm.</li>
        <li>If you have pets purchase an alarm system that is tolerant of pets (pet immune).  You may not want to purchase <a href="{% url sensors %}#motion-detector" title="Click to learn about our Motion Detectors">>motion detectors</a> if your pets have free run of the house when the alarm is on.  Barking dogs can activate <a href="{% url sensors %}#glass-break-sensor" title="Click to learn about our Glass Break Sensors">glass break detectors</a>. (under certain conditions)</li>
        <li>Mylar balloons.</li>
        <li>Drafts that move plants and curtains.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>At your business watch for these pitfalls that may activate your alarm:</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Swinging doors or windows.</li>
        <li>Banners or signs.</li>
        <li>Mylar balloons.</li>
        <li>Plants or curtains caught in drafts.</li>
        <li>Seasonal decorations.</li>
        <li>Stacked items such as boxes that may fall setting off motion detectors.</li>
        <li>Unsupervised guests.</li>
        <li>Untrained, unaware, or careless employees.</li>
        <li>Alarm equipment, such as <a href="{% url sensors %}#motion-detector" title="Click to learn about our Motion Detectors">motion sensors</a> or overhead <a href="{% url door-window-sensor %}" title="Click to learn about our Door / Window Sensors">door magnets</a> being hit by forklifts.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Contact your alarm dealer:</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>To <a href="{% url operation %}#test-system" title="How to test my GE Wireless Home Security System">test your system monthly</a>.</li>
        <li>If you plan home improvement or renovation projects such as changing phone systems (DSL, cable modem), the configuration of a room, adding a wall, rearranging cubicles, installing skylights, ceiling fans, etc.</li>
        <li>If you plan to fumigate.</li>
        <li>If you plan to change your alarm system batteries causing an interruption in you system's power supply.</li>
        <li>If you get a pet.</li>
        <li>If you hire a private contractor (domestic help, cleaning crew, Realtor, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>False Alarms:</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Divert emergency resources away from true emergencies.</li>
        <li>Are a nuisance to you and your neighbors.</li>
        <li>Make your security system less reliable.</li>
        <li>Costs you and your community money.</li>
    </ul>
