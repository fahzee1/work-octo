    <h2>How do I Test My System?</h2>
    <p>To ensure your GE wireless alarm monitoring system is communicating properly, an alarm will have to be sent to the alarm company monitoring station.  Call the alarm company monitoring station to place your account on test; this is to prevent false alarms.  The number to the alarm company monitoring station is 877-274-0604.  Ask for Customer Care.  The alarm company monitoring station will ask you to provide them with your name or the address where the system is located and your password.  You will be able to place the account on test for one hour.  After your account has been placed on test, please follow these steps.</p>
