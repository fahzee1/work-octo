            <h2>Installation of Motion Detector</h2>
            <p>The <a href="{% url equipment %}#motion-detector" title="Home Security Wireless Motion Detector">home security wireless motion detector</a> is designed to protect the interior of your home and will serve as a secondary line of defense if an intruder gets past your protected entry points. It is best to place motion detectors in the corner of high traffic areas such as a living room or hallway. </p>
            <p>When installing the wireless motion detector, it is important that the light is at the bottom of the sensor prior to mounting. To install the motion detector, the preferred method is to use the included velcro adhesive, or you can screw your motion detector in place.</p>
            <p><strong>Warning! Be sure that the view of the motion detector is not pointed towards a window and also be sure that you do not mount it near any type of heating source, like a fireplace or heating vent, as these could potentially cause false alarms. Please see page 6 of your installation manual for visual instructions.</strong></p>
            <h3>Preferred Method: Velcro Adhesive</h3>
            <p>Remove the plastic film, located on the sides of the motion detector. Mount the motion detector between 6 ½ to 7 feet from the finished floor. Finally, press the motion detector firmly in place so that it sticks to the wall.</p>
            <h3>Alternative Method: Screw Detector to the Wall</h3>
            <p>Remove the back plate of the wireless motion detector by opening the sensor and removing the circuit board. The back plate will be used as the mounting bracket. Use a small Philips screwdriver to punch out the holes (from the inside) on the angled sides of the mounting bracket by twisting the screwdriver. Now that the holes are punched, clean off any rough edges. Secure the mounting bracket to the wall between 6 ½ to 7 feet from the finished floor with the screws and anchors provided in the packet. Snap the circuit board back into place and then snap the cover back on the motion detector. If the head of the screws do not fit flush inside the holes, the motion detector circuit board will not snap back into the bracket after it has been mounted on the wall.</p>

            <h2>Installation of a Door Sensor</h2>
            <p>Familiarize yourself with the <a href="{% url equipment %}" title=" Home Security Wireless Equipment">home security wireless equipment</a>. Lay out the home security wireless sensors and magnets side by side using the alignment arrows.</p>
            <p>Your <a href="{% url door-window-sensor %}" title="Home Security Wireless Door Sensors">home security wireless door sensors</a> are important detection points - 75% of all break-ins occur through a door. Use common sense when installing home security wireless sensors - remember that the objective is to make sure that the sensor and magnet are located within 3/4” of each other. (<em>See Figure 1</em>) Be sure the home security wireless sensor and magnet are not obstructing the opening of the door.</p>
            <p>Hold the home security wireless sensor near the top of the door, close to the opening edge of the door (not the hinge side). This is the mounting location for the sensor. Hold the magnet on the doorframe next to the sensor. The alignment marks must match up. (<em>See Figure 2</em>) The sensor and magnet must be within 3/4 of an inch from each other in order to operate properly. This is the mounting location for the magnet.</p>
            <p>Now that you have determined the proper location you can attach the home security wireless sensor and magnet. Thoroughly clean the mounting location with a clean, dry cloth. Remove the protective backing off the 3M strip on the sensor. Make sure the home security wireless sensor is straight and is close to the edge of the door. Attach the sensor to the door. Press firmly and hold in place for 30 seconds.</p>
            <p>Now remove the protective backing off the 3M strip on the magnet. Make sure the alignment marks are facing each other. Attach the magnet on the doorframe next to the sensor. Press firmly and hold in place for 30 seconds. When the magnet is moved more than a few inches from the sensor, the alarm will be activated if the home security wireless system is armed.</p>

            <h2>Installation of our Window Sensors</h2>
            <p>Our window sensors are the exact same equipment as the door sensors and are basically installed the same way - remember that the objective is to make sure that the sensor and magnet are located within 3/4” of each other. <strong>Be sure the sensor and magnet are not obstructing the opening of the window.</strong></p>
            <p>Open and close the window so you can see how the window works in order to determine the mounting location.  Remember that the alignment mark on the home security wireless sensor should always be facing the magnet.</p>
            <p>Home security wireless sensors should be mounted on the moving part of the window. The magnet should be mounted to the window frame.</p>
            <p>Making sure the sensor is straight and is not obstructing the opening of the window. Secure the sensor using the adhesive provided.</p>
            <p>Use 3M adhesive on the magnet.  Place the magnet on the window frame of the window making sure the arrows on the magnet and sensor are aligned. Press firmly and hold in place for 30 seconds.  Clean off any excess adhesive.</p>
