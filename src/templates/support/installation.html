        <h2>Installation of Motion Detector</h2>
        <p>The most common location for a <a href="{% url equipment %}#motion-detector" title="Home Security Wireless Motion Detector">home security wireless motion detector</a> is a hallway or a living room. Your home security wireless motion detector should be flat mounted on a wall looking down the hallway or in a living room. The ideal height for installation is 6 ½ to 7 ½ feet off the finished floor. Always follow these instructions for mounting height.</p>
        <p>Remove the back plate of the home security wireless motion detector; this is the mounting bracket. Use a small Philips screwdriver to punch out the appropriate holes from the inside of the mounting bracket.</p>
        <p>Now that the holes are punched, clean off any rough edges. If the head of the screws do not fit flush inside the holes, the home security wireless motion detector will not snap back into the bracket after it has been mounted on the wall.</p>
        <p>Secure the mounting bracket to the wall with the screws and anchors provided in the packet, or use the adhesive provided.</p>
        <p><strong>Warning! All motion sensors should be placed in a climate-controlled area to prevent false alarms.</strong></p>

        <h2>Installation of a Door Sensor</h2>
        <p>Familiarize yourself with the <a href="{% url equipment %}" title=" Home Security Wireless Equipment">home security wireless equipment</a>. Lay out the home security wireless sensors and magnets side by side using the alignment arrows.</p>
        <p>Your <a href="{% url door-window-sensor %}" title="Home Security Wireless Door Sensors">home security wireless door sensors</a> are important detection points - 75% of all break-ins occur through a door. Use common sense when installing home security wireless sensors - remember that the objective is to make sure that the sensor and magnet are located within 3/8” of each other. (<em>See Figure 1</em>) Be sure the home security wireless sensor and magnet are not obstructing the opening of the door.</p>
        <p>Hold the home security wireless sensor near the top of the door, close to the opening edge of the door (not the hinge side). This is the mounting location for the sensor. Hold the magnet on the doorframe next to the sensor. The alignment marks must match up. (<em>See Figure 2</em>) The sensor and magnet must be within 3/8 of an inch from each other in order to operate properly. This is the mounting location for the magnet.</p>
        <p>Now that you have determined the proper location you can attach the home security wireless sensor and magnet. Thoroughly clean the mounting location with a clean, dry cloth. Remove the protective backing off the 3M strip on the sensor. Make sure the home security wireless sensor is straight and is close to the edge of the door. Attach the sensor to the door. Press firmly and hold in place for 30 seconds.</p>
        <p>Now remove the protective backing off the 3M strip on the magnet. Make sure the alignment marks are facing each other. Attach the magnet on the doorframe next to the sensor. Press firmly and hold in place for 30 seconds. When the magnet is moved more than ½ inch from the sensor, the alarm will be activated if the home security wireless system is armed.</p>

        <h2>Installation of our Window Sensors</h2>
        <p>Our window sensors are the exact same equipment as the door sensors and are basically installed the same way - remember that the objective is to make sure that the sensor and magnet are located within 3/8” of each other. <strong>Be sure the sensor and magnet are not obstructing the opening of the window.</strong></p>
        <p>Open and close the window so you can see how the window works in order to determine the mounting location.  Remember that the alignment mark on the home security wireless sensor should always be facing the magnet.</p>
        <p>Home security wireless sensors should be mounted on the moving part of the window. The magnet should be mounted to the window frame.</p>
        <p>Making sure the sensor is straight and is not obstructing the opening of the window. Secure the sensor using the adhesive provided.</p>
        <p>Use 3M adhesive on the magnet.  Place the magnet on the window frame of the window making sure the arrows on the magnet and sensor are aligned. Press firmly and hold in place for 30 seconds.  Clean off any excess adhesive.</p>
