        <p><a href="{% url home %}" title="Protect America Home Security | www.protectamerica.com" >Protect America</a>, Inc. is committed to protecting any personal information that you may provide to us. In particular, we believe it is important for you to know how we treat information about you that we may receive from this Web site.</p>

    <div id="information-collected">
        <h2>Information Collected</h2>
        <p>In general, you can visit this Web site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. Our web servers also seek (as many Web sites do) to place a "cookie" (a small data file) on your computer's hard drive.  This allows the server to determine the computer when it visits again.  We use this information in order to track statistical information about navigation to and throughout certain areas of our site, and to <abbr title="Protect America, Inc.">PAI</abbr> promotions on other sites. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.  This cookie is not used to obtain your name or any personal data, and the information that is tracked is used only for internal purposes, such as to improve site navigation and to measure the effectiveness of our promotional placements, and is not shared with anyone other than <abbr title="Protect America, Inc.">PAI</abbr> affiliates and contractors who assist <abbr title="Protect America, Inc.">PAI</abbr> in these efforts and are bound to confidentiality. However, if you prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your browser to reject them or to alert you before one is placed.</p>
        
        <p>In addition, there are portions of this Web site where we may need to collect personal information from you for a specific purpose, such as to provide you with certain information you request. The information collected from you may include your name, address, telephone, fax number, or e-mail address.</p>
        
        <p>We use a third-party technology to place our advertisements on other Web sites. This technology will install a small "cookie" file on your computer when you view our ad. These cookies will not contain any information that personally identifies you (such as your name or e-mail address) but they will contain a randomly generated number that is unique to your browser and can be recognized by a "Web beacon" (transparent GIF file) on our site if you click through to our site from one of our ads. This allows us to keep track of how many unique visitors we have to our site and from what ads they entered, so that we can measure the effectiveness of our ads and ad placements. The privacy policies of the Web sites on which we advertise, and through which the cookies are installed should inform you about the cookie, and you may of course set your browser to reject cookies. To learn more about the third-party ad-serving technology that we use, cookies, and how to "opt-out," please <a href="mailto:info@protectamerica.com" title="Protect America | Email: Information" >email us</a>.</p>
        
        <p>This Web site is not intended for persons under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from or about children, and we do not knowingly market our products or services to children.</p>

    <div id="security-collected-information">
        <h2>Security of Collected Information</h2>
        <p>We maintain strict physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized or inappropriate access. We restrict access to information about you to those <abbr title="Protect America, Inc.">PAI</abbr> workers who need to know the information to respond to your inquiry or request. Workers who misuse personal information are subject to disciplinary action.</p>
        
        <p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  To learn more about SSL, follow this link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssl" title="Protect America | More Information on SSL Certificates" class="external" >http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssl</a>.</p>
        
        <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        
        <p>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@protectamerica.com" title="Protect America | Email: Webmaster" >webmaster@protectamerica.com</a>.</p>

        assurance purposes. We do not record the calls for the purpose of collecting your Personal Information. If we record
        the telephone conversation, we will notify you before the conversation begins. In addition to ProtectAmerica.com,
