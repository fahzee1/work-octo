        <h2>How We Exceed Above the Rest</h2>
        <h3>Price</h3> 
        <p>There is no other alarm system company in the nation that gives its customers enough equipment to secure their entire home. We even give it to you for free! Protect America has a low price guarantee that’s unbeaten in the home security industry.</p>
        <h3>Monitoring</h3>
        <p>There is no other alarm system company in the nation that gives its customers enough equipment to secure their entire home. We even give it to you for free and you own it! Protect America has a low price guarantee that’s unbeaten in the home security industry.</p>
        <h3>Locked-In Rates</h3>
        <p>Protect America customers never have to worry about their bills getting higher. Your monitoring rate stays the same for the length of your contract. Most companies, including FrontPoint, have an “escalation clause” in their contracts that give them the right to raise customer’s monitoring rates! FrontPoint’s contracts say they can increase your rates by as much as 5 percent a year! Not with Protect America.</p>
        <h3>Fully Customized Packges</h3>
        <p>No two homes have the exact same security needs. Protect America recognizes this and provides enough door/window sensors to protect ALL the points of entry into your home. No matter how big or small, Protect America has you covered. Customers can also add life saving home security accessories, like smoke detectors and interactive video cameras.</p>

        <p>As long as you’re a customer with Protect America, we our lifetime warrant will ensure your you’re home security system will work. If there’s ever a problem, we fix it. Most national competitors charge extra for a warranty or only offer short term coverage. FrontPoint, for example, only guarantees their equipment for 2 years.</p>
        <h3>Cellular Interactive Monitoring</h3>
        <p>No need for wires to keep your home secure! Our cellular interactive monitoring links your home to our monitoring center via a secure, cellular connection. Cellular monitoring from Protect America also includes interactive features that gives you access to your home security system from any Internet-enabled computer or smartphone.</p>

We pre-program the system to you and then our home security experts will walk you through the installation process step by step in a matter of minutes. The best part?

        <h2>The Best Home Security Systems and Accessories</h2>
        <p>Protect America only uses high quality security systems made by GE. Our products are so reliable, we offer a Lifetime Replacement Parts Warranty with each security system sold. If a part breaks, we replace it. No limitations or tricks, unlike some companies that only offer a 2-year, limited warranty.</p>
        <h2>Award-Winning Security Monitoring</h2>
        <p>Quality security service at an affordable price draws attention… and awards.</p>
        <p>Protect America has received the coveted 5-star rating from TopConsumerReviews.com for the last 5 years. In addition, our Copper Security Package has been named a Consumer’s Digest Best Buy since 2008. Other companies can’t beat our prices and service. Most won’t even try!</p>
        <h2>Protect America is "the company to beat!"</h2>
        <p>A Secure Life has noticed it and you should too! No company can match Protect America’s affordability and quality. That’s why A Secure Life said, "Customers who choose Protect America over comparable systems from many other home security providers save money and receive products that have more options."</p>
