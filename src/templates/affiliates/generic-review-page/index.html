        <h2>How We Exceed Above the Rest</h2>
        <h3>Price</h3> 
        <p>There is no other alarm system company in the nation that gives its customers enough equipment to secure their entire home. We even give it to you for free! Protect America has a low price guarantee that’s unbeaten in the home security industry.</p>

        <h3>Locked-In Rates</h3>
        <p>Protect America customers never have to worry about their bills getting higher. Your monitoring rate stays the same for the length of your contract. Most companies, including FrontPoint, have an “escalation clause” in their contracts that give them the right to raise customer’s monitoring rates! FrontPoint’s contracts say they can increase your rates by as much as 5 percent a year! Not with Protect America.</p>
        <h3>Fully Customized Packges</h3>
        <p>No two homes have the exact same security needs. Protect America recognizes this and provides enough door/window sensors to protect ALL the points of entry into your home. No matter how big or small, Protect America has you covered. Customers can also add life saving home security accessories, like smoke detectors and interactive video cameras.</p>

Most national competitors charge extra for a warranty or only offer short term coverage. FrontPoint, for example, only guarantees their equipment for 2 years.</p>
