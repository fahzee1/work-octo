	    	<p>If you have just been recently broken into or know someone who has, you are now looking for the best way to secure you home or apartment. I trust Protect America as their equipment holds up to the task of time. I have been a customer for over 5 years and have never had a problem. Any time that I needed a question answered, they were extremely helpful and did not presser me into obtaining any additional items or equipment. The agent listened to my needs and offered me options that could meet them within my price range. I shopped other companies and none could offer what I received from Protect America. I have since recommended Protect America to over 10 of my closest friends and family. Several have taken me up on the recommendation and have not been broken into since. I have spoken to several of my neighbors that have other security systems and they have still been broken into because there were gaps in their system. Good luck, I am sure you will make the correct decision for you and your family.</p>

	    	<p>We purchased and installed a home security system from Protect America. Both the sales and service were outstanding. Sergio was our sales representative. He was knowledgeable, helpful, and answered all of our questions completely. Our system was shipped the same day and we received it a few days later. Kerry, our installation tech, called us about an hour after the kit arrived to schedule time for him to talk us through set up. He was also wonderful with setting up our system, answering all of our questions and providing lots of support. He also gave us lots of online information to read and file. Super job!</p>

	    	<p>The entire Protect America Team made my Purchase and Installation process simple and easy. James was very knowledgeable of products and services to help me make the right selection that best suit my personal needs. In addition Keith's expertise and skills made installation a breeze. Lastly, and the most difficult part of my installation was the Video Camera. However, Jovanni worked me thru the process and would not quit until the installation was complete and operational! Very High Regards To The Protect America Team!</p>

	    	<p>Protect America’s alarm system is a great system along with awesome customer care. I installed the system in the beginning of August. The system was loaded with sensors, key fobs, a touch screen, and a cellular based control panel. I also got the in car GPS based monitoring service. The installation was fairly simple and I had the luxury of their staff coaching me through the installation. The system is highly customizable and you can add a ton of optional sensors to the system. It even has intelligent house control through the Zwave control module built right into the panel. Overall, the system has surpassed my expectations with the hightly customizable and interactive system.. If you are looking for a top of the line system with easy budget control, Protect America is an awesome security service providers.</p>

	    	<p>We have had an increase in the number of crimes in our local area and spent days researching home security systems. Protect America offered a “do-it-yourself” installation with easy-to-follow instructions. On the day we received our system, we were contacted by Protect America shortly after the UPS delivery. The installation expert called every 20 minutes to check our status and see how the installation was going. He was professional, personable, and extremely helpful. We were very excited with the end product once installation was complete. Window & doors sensors, motion sensors, fire system, remote control access, and even an iPhone app to arm & disarm the system. This is an incredible deal!!</p>

	    	<p>I have been a satisfied customer for 11 years now. I’ve upgraded my alarm system twice and my experience with the sales, set up, activation and customer service have been nothing short of excellent! Protect America has the best customer service in the business. No doubt about it. Everyone is pleasant and a true professional. Protect America has the best equipment and the lowest monthly monitoring fee out there.</p>

	    	<p>I’ve had this system for 7+ years, easy to set up, I understand they have newer system available , may try it but the old ones working great. The motion sensor to me is the most important part, even if they get through door/window the motion sensor picks up signal very quick. Also great protection for family member that’s left alone when everyone else leaves for work, My most recent experience was with cust service Mark, very helpful and professional. He offered new products and told me the features, we discussed pros & cons and their was no high pressure sales, he thanked me for being long time customer and said they were always available.if I needed anything. Wish more larger American companies would take notice and learn what excellent customer should be like!</p>

	    	<p>I am very happy with the service. Over the years I've been able to build a very nice home security system at little to most of the time no cost. I just upgraded to wireless monitoring which was so greatly discounted it was too good of a deal to refuse. After I did upgrade I realized I actually saved money as there are no phone charges for the wireless connection. When the offer was available, Protect America called me to give me the offer, I wasn't trying to negotiate. 
I am more than happy with the service and cost of this product. I wish all my utility companies were this good. I would and have recommend this company to my friends.</p>
