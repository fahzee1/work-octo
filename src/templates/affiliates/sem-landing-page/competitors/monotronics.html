{% block lifestyle-subhead %}<p>Quality, user-friendly technology is a must, but so is affordability. We believe everyone should be able to protect themselves, no matter the budget. That’s why we’ve shaped our packages to be within anyone’s reach. <strong>Each package we offer comes with no equipment fees, a Lowest Price Guarantee, and starts at just $19.99.</strong>We can’t say the same for some other providers, whose base prices can start at $34.95 - almost $15 more a month for the same amount of equipment and services. Then add an activation fee of $99-$149 and you can see how costs will quickly add up. </p>{% endblock %}

                  <h3>What makes Protect America different?</h3>
                    <p>Price and convenience. We believe everyone should be able to protect themselves without enormous payments and unnecessary fees. It’s how we’ve secured over half a million homes in the U.S. and Canada. Convenience and flexibility means being able to select what you want and leave out what you don’t need: instead of being confined to mandatory packages. We’ll help you create a plan that fits your home and lifestyle, because that’s the way it should be.</p>

                  <h3>What if I move?</h3>
                    <p>No problem. Just give us a call and we’ll update your information, plus take you through the steps to move your equipment. We’ll even send you a moving kit! Protect America never charges its customers to move service to a new home or requires a new contract to be signed. Some other companies require you to sign a new contract of at least 36 months if you move to a new residence.</p>

                  <h3>What is the installation process like?</h3>
                  <p>We’ve developed a unique process that avoids needless installation fees and having strange technicians walking through your home. The beauty of Protect America technology is that it’s wireless and pre-programmed by our specialists, so forget running wires or complicated tasks. Once a security expert has worked with you to create a plan for your house, we ship a custom security system right to your door. Then, when you have some time, call us and one of our installation professionals will take you through the process step-by-step. On average, it takes less than an hour. We’ll help you place your system, and then test to make sure everything is working correctly. Wireless technology is extremely user-friendly, and doesn’t need a professional to install.</p>

This technology allows you to control door locks, your security system, lights, appliances and more – all from a smartphone, tablet or computer. Not only is it convenient, it’s a way to stay more connected to your home. Receive text messages in the event of an alarm, view live footage on your phone with wireless cameras and always be in the driver’s seat.</p>
