{% block lifestyle-headline %}<h2>SimpliSafe Home Security &ndash; Buyer Beware</h2>{% endblock %}

{% block lifestyle-subhead %}<p>Simplisafe seems attractive, but hundreds of dollars in upfront costs actually end up costing you more overall than Protect America. Add only 5 years of business experience and notoriously questionable equipment and you can see how Simplisafe will cost you more in money and frustration. Protect America is a national security authority with over 22 years of experience and more than half a million homes secured in all 50 states. We’ve been a Consumer’s Digest Best Buy for 5 years in a row!</p>{% endblock %}

                <div>
                  <h3>What kind of investment is this?</h3>
                    <p>Protecting your home is an important step, but that doesn’t mean it should break the bank. Protect America is affordable, effective and has a lifetime warranty on name brand equipment. We can’t say the same for SimpliSafe, whose inexperience and low quality equipment take their toll. This is an investment in your home and family, and can cost as low as a dollar a day.</p>

                <div>
                  <h3>How do prices compare between companies?</h3>
                  <p>SimpliSafe charges at least $14.99 per month (that’s not including their upfront fee $229.96 for equipment) to monitor company-made (not name brand) equipment. Compare that to Protect America’s $19.99 per month, zero installation fees and name brand equipment. Our technology is DIY and very easy to install, so savings are handed down to the homeowner. We’re also resolute about providing a completely free security system with each of our packages, because protecting your home from intruders shouldn’t break your budget.</p>

                  <h3>What happens when my alarm system is triggered? How will the monitoring station respond?</h3>
                  <p>If your system is not disarmed, our monitoring station will attempt to reach you. If you do not answer, we will dispatch the local Police to the monitoring address and will attempt to reach your emergency contacts.</p>

                  <p>If any part of your system malfunctions, we replace it without charge – no matter how long you’ve been under contract. Not so with SimpliSafe. Their limited equipment warranty only lasts three (3) years. Imagine having to pay costly replacement fees for equipment you’ve already purchased! You can take comfort in knowing your home is safe and wallet protected with Protect America’s Lifetime Replacement Parts warranty.</p>
