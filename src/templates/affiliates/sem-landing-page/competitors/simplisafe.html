{% block lifestyle-subhead %}<p>SimpliSafe seems attractive, but hundreds of dollars in upfront costs actually ends up costing you more. Add in a lack of experience (SimpliSafe has only been around for five years) and notoriously questionable equipment and you can see how SimpliSafe doesn’t measure up.</p><br />

                <div>
                  <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
                    <p>Protecting your home is important, but that doesn’t mean it should cost you an arm and a leg. SimpliSafe charges up to $230 for equipment and activation upfront – and that’s not even including monthly monitoring fees! We have no equipment fees and we are adamant about offering <strong>free equipment</strong> with each of our packages – saving you money from day one. </p>

                  <h3>How do prices compare between companies?</h3>
                  <p>SimpliSafe charges $14.99 a month to monitor company-made (not name brand) equipment – but that doesn’t even include the $230 for equipment and activation upfront. For just $19.99 a month, we offer free name brand equipment with zero equipment and activation fees. Our Price Lock Guarantee also ensures that we never raise your monthly monitoring rates – something SimpliSafe can’t say. </p>
