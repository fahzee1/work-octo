        <p>Our security packages start at <strong>$19.99 a month and include free equipment</strong>.  We also match any price with our Lowest Price Guarantee. SafeMart offers a low monthly rate, but their large upfront equipment costs and costly warranties add up quickly.</p>

        <h3><i class="icon-heart"></i>Support That Cares.</h3>
        <p>SafeMart often asks their customers to be their own technicians – performing complicated fixes that can take hours. Not so with us. Our wireless equipment is easy to operate and our CARE Experts are trained specifically to do just that – care. If your equipment still doesn’t work, <strong>we’ll give you a new one for free</strong>.</p>
