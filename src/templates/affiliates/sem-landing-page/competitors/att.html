                  <h3>What if I don’t know exactly what I need?</h3>
                    <p>We have been a pioneer of wireless home security for over 20 years. We take the time to listen, learn your situation, then make effective, affordable suggestions. No two homes are the same, so we will approach every household with an open mind. Huge corporations like AT&T sometimes have long wait times and make it difficult to speak with a real person. Not so with Protect America.</p>

                    <p>Protecting your home is important, but that doesn’t mean it should cost you an arm and a leg. AT&T Digital Life charges an upfront fee of $149.99 for equipment – and that’s not even including monthly monitoring fees! We have no equipment fees and we are adamant about offering free equipment with each of our packages – saving you money from day one. </p>
