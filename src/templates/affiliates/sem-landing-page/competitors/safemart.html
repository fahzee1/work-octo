                <div>
                  <h3>What happens when my alarm system is triggered? How will the monitoring station respond?</h3>
                    <p>If your system is not disarmed, our monitoring station will attempt to reach you. If you do not answer, we will dispatch the local Police to the monitoring address and will attempt to reach your emergency contacts.</p>

                <div>
                  <h3>Is service available everywhere?</h3>
                  <p>With Protect America it is. We’re a national home security company serving all 50 states and Canada. SafeMart is only available in select areas, and homeowners are required to research whether or not their home qualifies for service.</p>

                  <h3>What kind of investment is this?</h3>
                  <p>This is an investment in your home and family, and can cost as low as a dollar a day.  Protecting your home is an important step, but that doesn’t mean it should break the bank. Imagine having to spend over $300 on equipment from SafeMart, only to spend more money on a warranty. Home security is designed to reduce stress, not create more with large fees.</p>

                  <h3>How do prices compare between companies?</h3>
                  <p>SafeMart charges relatively low monthly rates but then asks for huge equipment fees upfront. A comparable system from SafeMart costs $315.85, and that’s before the monthly fees are added. Compare that to Protect America’s $19.99 per month and zero equipment fees on all packages. Our technology is DIY and very easy to install, so savings are passed on to the homeowner. We’re adamant about offering free equipment with each of our packages, because defending your home from robbery shouldn’t require you to rob your wallet.</p>
