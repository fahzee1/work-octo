{% block h1 %}Cellular Company Home Automation – Convenient?{% endblock %}
{% block h2 %}Home automation shouldn't come with a catch.{% endblock %}

{% block lifestyle-headline %}<h2>Want to Create a Smarthome? Skip the Red Tape.</h2>{% endblock %}

{% block lifestyle-subhead %}<p>Cellular companies are beginning to provide home automation (commonly confused for a security system, which many don’t offer). It is simply a version of a very common home automation platform called Z-Wave. Like any other Z-Wave systes, it allows you to control door locks, energy use and lights from a smartphone. Here’s the catch – you’re required to be an existing wireless or TV customer to even get the service. Once you’ve paid hundreds of dollars for service, expect to shell out anywhere from around $70 to about $219.99 for equipment, plus a monthly monitoring fee. Our suggestion: go with flexibility. Protect America home automation integrates easily with security technology to give you safety and control, greatly increasing the quality of home and life.</p>{% endblock %}

        <h3><i class="icon-ban-circle"></i>No Red Tape</h3>
        <p>Big cell companies require you to already have their wireless and/or TV service before you’re allowed to get home automation. Subscription fees for their bundled services run at least $89 a month, then add the equipment fees and an extra $10 a month. Compare that to Protect America’s base price of $37.99 a month for a secure, automation-ready home.</p>

                  <h3>How does my home automation equipment get installed?</h3>
                    <p>This wireless technology is designed to be extremely user friendly. It’s so simple that the devices don’t require a professional installation, and you could do it yourself. Good thing you won’t have to. This technology is virtually “plug and play”, but one of our security experts will guide you through the simple process over the phone whenever is most convenient. This way, needless installation fees are cut and savings are passed on to you!</p>

                  <h3>How is Protect America’s home automation technology different than big cell companies’?</h3>
                    <p>These companies and Protect America both use the Z-Wave home automation platform. This allows door locks, lights, appliances and a host of other devices to be controlled from the ease of a smartphone. The difference – big cell companies require you be a subscriber to TV and Internet service that can cost $90 a month or more. Plus, their options are in limited packages.</p>

                  <h3>What is Z-Wave?</h3>
                  <p>Z-Wave is the technology that makes home automation possible. It expands the web of security around your house to include devices like digital door locks, light dimmers, appliance modules and more. That’s not all, however. It allows you to control all of these devices, including your security system, from the ease of a mobile device.</p>

                  <p>Protect America has the lowest price in the industry, plus no installation fees due to the simple DIY “plug and play” nature of our technology. Compare our $19.99 per month to competitor monthly fees for the same coverage plus their installation fees, and you’ll see why we’re one of the top national security companies in America. We also never change monitoring fees, unlike other providers who can adjust monthly fees at will. We’re dedicated to providing quality security at affordable prices to homeowners everywhere, because everyone should be able to protect their home and their wallet.</p>
