{% block h1 %}Verizon Home Automation – not that convenient.{% endblock %}
{% block h2 %}Home automation shouldn't come with a catch.{% endblock %}

{% block lifestyle-headline %}<h2>Want to Create a Smarthome? Skip the Red Tape.</h2>{% endblock %}

{% block lifestyle-subhead %}<p>Verizon Home Monitoring and Control is commonly confused for a security system, which Verizon doesn’t actually offer. It is simply their version of a very common home automation platform called Z-Wave, which allows you to control door locks, energy use and lights from a smartphone. Here’s the catch, though – you’re required to be a Verizon customer to even get the service. Once you’ve paid hundreds of dollars for Verizon service, expect to shell out anywhere from around $70 to about $219.99 for equipment, plus a monthly monitoring fee. Our suggestion: go with flexibility. Choose what you want in your home and don’t be limited to packages. Protect America home automation integrates easily with security technology to give you safety and control, greatly increasing the quality of home and life.</p>{% endblock %}

        <h3><i class="icon-ban-circle"></i>No Red Tape</h3>
        <p>Verizon requires you to already have their wireless and/or TV service before you’re allowed to get home automation. Subscription fees for their bundled services run at least $89 a month, then add the equipment fees and an extra $10 a month. Compare that to Protect America’s base price of $37.99 a month for a secure, automation-ready home.</p>

                  <h3>How does my home automation equipment get installed?</h3>
                    <p>This wireless technology is designed to be extremely user friendly. It’s so simple that the devices don’t require a professional installation, and you could do it yourself. Good thing you won’t have to. This technology is virtually “plug and play”, but one of our security experts will guide you through the simple process over the phone whenever is most convenient. This way, needless installation fees are cut and savings are passed on to you!</p>

                  <h3>How is Protect America’s home automation technology different than Verizon’s?</h3>
                    <p>Verizon and Protect America both use the Z-Wave home automation platform. This allows door locks, lights, appliances and a host of other devices to be controlled from the ease of a smartphone. The difference – Verizon requires you be a subscriber to TV and Internet service that can cost $90 a month or more. Plus, Verizon’s options are in limited packages.</p>

                <div>
                  <h3>What is Z-Wave?</h3>
                  <p>Z-Wave is the technology that makes home automation possible. It expands the web of security around your house to include devices like digital door locks, light dimmers, appliance modules and more. That’s not all, however. It allows you to control all of these devices, including your security system, from the ease of a mobile device.</p>

                  <p>Protect America technology is entirely customizable. Choose which parts of your home you’d like to secure and automate, and choose what’s right for you. Compare that to Verizon, who requires you to select from only three home automation packages. Have specific questions about equipment or need suggestions for your situation? Our experts are diligently trained to listen and ask questions before making recommendations. We’ll help you build a safer, more connected home at an affordable price.</p>
