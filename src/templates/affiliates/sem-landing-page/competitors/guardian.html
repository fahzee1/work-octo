Home security should be as affordable as it is effective, so why pay multiple fees and jump through hoops just to defend your home? Protect America offers the lowest price in the industry, doesn’t require installation fees and does not fine customers when they move to a new home.</p>{% endblock %}

                <div>
                  <h3>How do prices compare between companies?</h3>
                    <p>Guardian Security begins with a $29.95 fee per month for the most inexpensive package. Then add equipment and installation fees and you’re looking at a lot of money. Compare this to Protect America’s base package - $19.99 per month and no extra required services and fees. Our technology is DIY and very easy to install, so savings are passed on to the homeowner. We’re also adamant about offering free equipment with each of our packages, because defending your home from robbery shouldn’t necessitate you robbing your wallet.</p>

                  <h3>Can I move with my Protect America or Guardian Security system?</h3>
                  <p>Protect America security systems are completely wireless and mobile. Not so with every security company. Easily move it to your new home for free, and feel free to call our world-class security team if you need any guidance. Guardian Security requires you to present an original “certificate” document they give you upon signing (instead of simply letting their customers move their service to a new home for free). If the customer doesn’t have the document, fees are charged. Even if the document is presented, the homeowner is required to sign a contract for an additional 60 months of service.</p>
