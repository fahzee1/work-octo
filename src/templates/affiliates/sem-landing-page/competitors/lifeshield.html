{% block lifestyle-headline %}<h2>Never settle for mediocre.</h2>{% endblock %}

{% block lifestyle-subhead %}<p>Company-made equipment, a short warranty and higher costs have homeowners wondering what’s in it for them. LifeShield’s in-house manufactured equipment does not compare to professional name brand technology. Nor does their one year limited warranty. Choose name brand equipment, a lifetime warranty and the lowest monthly rates in the industry.</p>{% endblock %}

                    <p>If your system is not disarmed, our monitoring station will attempt to reach you. If you do not answer, we will dispatch the local Police to the monitoring address and will attempt to reach your emergency contacts.</p>

                  <h3>Is service available everywhere?</h3>
                  <p>With Protect America it is. We’re a national home security company serving all 50 states and Canada. LifeShield is only available in select areas, and homeowners are required to research whether or not their home qualifies for service. </p>

                  <h3>What kind of investment is this?</h3>
                  <p>Protecting your home is an important step, but that doesn’t mean it should break the bank. Protect America is affordable, effective and has a lifetime warranty on name brand equipment. We can’t say the same for LifeShield. This is an investment in your home and family, and can cost as low as a dollar a day.  </p>

                  <h3>How do prices compare between companies?</h3>
                  <p>LifeShield charges at least $29.99 per month to monitor company-made (not name brand) equipment. Compare that to Protect America’s $19.99 per month, zero installation fees and name brand equipment. Our technology is DIY and very easy to install, so savings are passed on to the homeowner. We’re also adamant about offering free equipment with each of our packages, because defending your home from robbery shouldn’t require you to rob your wallet.</p>
