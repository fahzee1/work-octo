{% block lifestyle-headline %}<h2>Comcast Home Security (Xfinity) &ndash; Your Best Option?</h2>{% endblock %}

{% block lifestyle-subhead %}<p>Whether you’re looking for a safer or smarter home, it’s important to shop around. Large companies like Comcast don’t necessarily have the best solution for your house and family. Huge corporations treat you more like a number than a person, and it can be difficult to even get a hold of a real human being when you need to. We’ve built security options with you in mind. Flexible packages, available everywhere, and no crazy installation fees.</p>{% endblock %}
