{% block lifestyle-subhead %}<p>ADT customers pay plenty in high monthly fees. Add hundreds of dollars in installation fees and you begin to see why ADT users around the country have found a better deal in home security. That's because Protect America defends your home and your wallet. Every alarm package includes a lifetime equipment warranty, locked-in monitoring monthly rates, and the lowest price in the industry, guaranteed. That’s three simple things ADT can't offer.</p>{% endblock %}
