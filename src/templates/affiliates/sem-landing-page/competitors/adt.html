                  <h3>Can I move with my ADT equipment?</h3>
                  <p>With ADT, it could cost you hundreds of dollars to move your system to a new home. Home security companies like ADT that sell wired security systems often require additional fees for relocation. A big benefit of having a wireless home security system with us is that you can transfer your system and your service to your new home <b>for free!</b></p>

                  <p>ADT works with renters, but not only will you have to pay a relocation fee of $99-$199 when you move, but you will also have to re-sign a new 36-month agreement. We let our renting customers move their wireless systems to their new apartment or home without a penalty or signing a new agreement. Best of all, our low-impact wireless installation will guarantee that you get your security deposit back from the property owner.</p>
