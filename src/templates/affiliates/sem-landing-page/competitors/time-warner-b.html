{% block lifestyle-headline %}<h2>Why Time Warner Intelligent Home Can’t Compare</h2>{% endblock %}

{% block lifestyle-subhead %}<p>Would you trust your cable company to protect you? Large media companies like Time Warner don’t necessarily have the best solution for your house and family when it comes to home security. We are a security company first that doesn’t require expensive bundles that will cost you hundreds of dollars a month. We will build a customized alarm package for you and your home starting at <strong>$19.99 a week with no installation or equipment fees</strong>. That’s the Protect America difference.</p>{% endblock %}
