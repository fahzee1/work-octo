{% block lifestyle-headline %}<h2>Skip The Red Tape You Get With Verizon</h2>{% endblock %}

{% block lifestyle-subhead %}<p>Cellular companies like Verizon offer home automation, but this should not be confused with a full-feature security system. These Z-Wave technology systems allow you to control door locks, energy use and lights from a smartphone – but that’s all you get. On top of that, you’re required to have internet or TV with Verizon to even get home automation. Once you’ve paid hundreds of dollars for service, expect to shell out anywhere from $70 to $219 for equipment + a steep monthly monitoring fee. With us, <strong>you can get home security and home automation for much less</strong>. No bundles, no equipment or installation fees, no problems.</p>{% endblock %}
