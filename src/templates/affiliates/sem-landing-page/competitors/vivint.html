                  <h3>How do prices compare between companies?</h3>
                    <p>Protecting your home is an important step, but that doesn’t mean it should cost you an arm and a leg. Vivint charges an upfront fee of at least $99 for activation, and monthly rates start at $49.99 (compared to Protect America’s $19.99 base package). We’re adamant about offering free equipment with each of our packages, because defending your home shouldn’t require you to rob your wallet.</p>
