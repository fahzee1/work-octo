                            <p>We are very pleased with our new alarm system. The rep that signed us up was very helpful in providing us with different options and was always available when we had questions. Best of all there was no activation fee or hidden charges. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a security system at a decent cost.</p>

                            <p>I just got my Protect America home security system yesterday. Brian was my sales rep, and was very helpful changing my package to meet my needs, when I called the company to set up my system Avery helped me set it up. He was great, answered all my questions, and had me safe and protected in half an hour. This system works great and I have a med alert button to wear for health reasons. Because we have stalkers and live in a bad neighborhood , my children and I have had to take shifts (armed) to feel safe. We all slept with loaded guns, but last night I slept like a baby!!! Thank you for your great service! And this company calls the sheriff, fire dept, and the first responders for you within 60 seconds if an alarm goes off and you do not answer your phone. They also provide a duress code if you are being forced to turn off your alarm against your will... I highly recommend this system.</p>

                            <p>I have been extremely pleased with entire process of of buying, installing and setting up iPhone control of my mothers' alarm system. Your personnel were all courteous, professional, and efficient. The set up was a breeze. It was so simple. I had everything up in 20 minutes and thanks to josh the process was simple and not tedious or difficult. With your support anyone can set this up. Josh was extremely patient and professional and did not try to rush and at the end asked if he could do anything else to help. My mom now has a great alarm and an emergency button hanging around her neck, what peace of mind for her and me who lives 200 miles away. Rick ** was exceptional and very charismatic in helping me set up her iPhone to control the alarm. I have ADT. There is no comparison and I will be switching to protect america when my contract expires this June. Thank you all.</p>
