	    	<p>Having had the other "A" security where it cost $99 to have the system installed, I really appreciate Protect America. They are much better, open and honest and you don't have yearly increases in your bill that the other company failed to mention. Customer service is world class. I am always blown away by the fantastic people they have working with them. They even speak English without an accent! ( they are in Texas ). The times I've called to tweak my system they were knowledgeable and made it simple enough for this old man to follow. I really like that. Protect America was fast when I had a break in. The call came while I was only 1/2 mile away. I caught the idiot red handed. He now has 7 years free room and board from the State of Oklahoma to learn that you don't mess with Protect America. If you want a simple, good and easy to install system without the high pressure "installer" getting you to buy more sensors you don't really need, then try Protect America. They are the best I've found out there.</p>

	    	<p>We received and installed 2 systems yesterday! One for our church and it was handled without a hitch. Our home required a little more work but all was handled politely and efficiently and so far very good quality. (...) We LOVE the fact that we can arm and disarm by iPhone!!!</p>

	    	<p>I originally signed up with ADT, and the upfront cost was phenomenally expensive, as well as the monthly monitoring. I then quickly did a tremendous amount of research and kept coming back to Protect America. I was skeptical of "self-installation" and the whole process, but continued to find them rated number ONE in every single home security system review. I have never been disappointed since I ordered and became a customer. The customer service is exceptional as is the monitoring and product ease of set up and quality!!!</p>

	    	<p>If you have just been recently broken into or know someone who has, you are now looking for the best way to secure you home or apartment. I trust Protect America as their equipment holds up to the task of time. I have been a customer for over 5 years and have never had a problem. Any time that I needed a question answered, they were extremely helpful and did not presser me into obtaining any additional items or equipment. The agent listened to my needs and offered me options that could meet them within my price range. I shopped other companies and none could offer what I received from Protect America. I have since recommended Protect America to over 10 of my closest friends and family. Several have taken me up on the recommendation and have not been broken into since. I have spoken to several of my neighbors that have other security systems and they have still been broken into because there were gaps in their system. Good luck, I am sure you will make the correct decision for you and your family.</p>

	    	<p>I'm very happy with my security system. It's working exactly as expected. It's easy to install, just like they said. It's easy to manage. Overall I'm very happy with the experience. I'm thinking about expanding the service. (...) Everything works just as they said. I would recommend (and have) this system to others.</p>
