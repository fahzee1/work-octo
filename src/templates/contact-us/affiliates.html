            <h3>Mutual Non-disclosure Agreement</h3>
            <p>This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (Agreement) is dated as of <span class="blank">06/13/2012</span>, and is entered into between PROTECT AMERICA, INC., 5100 N IH-35, Suite B, Round Rock, TX 78681 and <abbr title="Independent Referral Agent">IR Agent</abbr>; collectively, the "Parties". The purpose of the Agreement is to assure the protection and preservation of the confidential and/or proprietary nature of information disclosed or made available to each other in connection regarding a possible business relationship by and between the Parties.</p>
            <p>NOW, THEREFORE, in furtherance of the relationship, and in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the Parties do hereby agree as follows:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>All information disclosed by one Party to the other Party, shall be deemed to be confidential and proprietary ("Proprietary Information"), except as set forth in paragraph 4 below. The Parties, their employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, and assigns agree to hold all Proprietary Information, regardless of when or how disclosed, in strict confidence and with not less than the same degree of care that they provide for their own confidential and proprietary information. The Parties warrant and represent that the degree of care contemplated herein is adequate and the Parties will take any and all steps reasonably necessary to preserve such Proprietary Information.</li>
                <li>The Parties, their employees, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents and assigns, shall make no disclosure of any Proprietary Information without the express written consent of the other Party, except as provided herein. In addition, neither Party shall use the Proprietary Information for any purpose other than the business relationship. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the receiving Party may disclose the Proprietary Information to such of the receiving Party's consultants, agents and affiliates ("Representative") which the receiving Party reasonably and in good faith believes has a need to know and that should be involved in the business relationship, provided such receiving Party Representative is informed of this Agreement and agrees to be bound by the terms hereof, and the receiving Party uses reasonable commercial efforts to cause the receiving Party Representative to observe the terms of this Agreement. The receiving Party agrees that a breach of this Agreement by a receiving Party Representative shall constitute a breach by the receiving Party. In the event that the receiving Party is required by applicable law, rule, regulation or lawful order or ruling of any court, government agency or regulatory commission to disclose any Proprietary Information, the receiving Party understands that the disclosing Party may desire to seek an appropriate protective order or take steps to protect the confidentiality of such Proprietary Information. Consequently, the receiving Party agrees that it will provide the disclosing Party with prompt notice of such request(s).</li>
                <li>This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect so long as either Party shall possess the Proprietary Information of the other Party and may be terminated by either Party. It is further agreed that any termination of this Agreement shall not relieve the receiving Party of its obligations under this Agreement with respect to Proprietary Information exchanged prior to the effective date of termination and the obligations with respect to Proprietary Information will remain in effect for a two year period following the termination of this Agreement</li>
                <li>Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or limit the receiving Parties' use of information that can be demonstrated as: (a) previously known to the receiving Party, (b) independently developed by the receiving Party, (c) acquired from a third party not under similar nondisclosure obligations to the disclosing Party, or (d) acquired through the public domain through no breach by the receiving Party of this Agreement.</li>
                <li>No rights or obligations other than those expressly recited herein are to be implied from this Agreement. In particular, no license is granted directly or indirectly under any patent or copyright now held by, or which may be obtained by, or which is or may be licensable by either Party. Further, with respect to the Proprietary Information, the Parties understand that such Proprietary Information is subject to change without notice at any time and that neither Party shall have any liability as a result of any change in Proprietary Information. The Parties acknowledge that neither Party, nor any of its respective employees, subsidiaries, agents or assigns makes any representations or warranties whatsoever concerning the accuracy, completeness or correctness of the Proprietary Information supplied hereunder, nor shall such representation or warranty be implied.</li>

                <li>Neither this Agreement, nor the disclosure of Proprietary Information, nor the ongoing discussions and correspondence between the Parties shall constitute or imply a commitment or binding obligation between the Parties or their respective affiliates, if any, regarding the subject matter of the Proprietary Information. If the Parties have entered or intend to enter into a binding commitment regarding the subject matter of the Proprietary Information, such commitment has been or will be explicitly stated in a separate written agreement executed by both Parties, and the Parties hereby affirm that they do not intend discussions, correspondence, and other activities to be construed as forming a contract regarding the subject matter of the Proprietary Information or any other transaction between them without execution of such separate written agreement.</li>
                <li>The Proprietary Information shall be deemed the property of the disclosing Party, and the receiving Party shall, at the disclosing Party's request, either destroy or return at the disclosing Party's expense all tangible expressions of the Proprietary Information provided to it, including, without limitation, documents, writings, designs, drawings, specifications and information incorporated in computer software or held in electronic storage media, and any copies thereof, to the disclosing Party. The rights and obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall survive any such return of Proprietary Information.</li>
                <li>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws. In the event any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unimpaired, and shall remain in effect and be binding upon the Parties.</li>
                <li>The failure of either Party to enforce or insist upon compliance with any term or condition of this Agreement, the waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement, or the granting of an extension of time for performance, shall not constitute the permanent waiver of any term or condition of this Agreement, and this Agreement and each of its provisions shall remain at all times in full force and effect until modified by the Parties in writing.</li>
                <li>This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding of the Parties and supersedes any and all prior agreements, arrangements or understandings related to the matter described herein. Each Party warrants and represents that the person executing this Agreement on its behalf is duly authorized to execute this Agreement, and to bind such Party to the terms and conditions contained herein.</li>
                <li>The Parties acknowledge that the Proprietary Information exchanged is valuable and unique and that disclosure in breach of this Agreement will result in irreparable injury to the adversely affected Party's Proprietary Information, for which monetary damages would be solely inadequate. Accordingly, the Parties agree the adversely affected Party shall have the right to seek an immediate injunction enjoining any such breach or threatened breach of the Agreement. The violating Party agrees to be responsible for all costs, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by the adversely affected Party in any action enforcing the terms of this Agreement.</li>

            </ol>
            <p>The Parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized representatives as of the day and year first above written.</p>
