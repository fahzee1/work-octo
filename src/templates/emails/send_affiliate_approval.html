Hi {{ aff.name }}

Congratulations! Your application to our affiliate program has been approved!

Here are the basic essentials you are going to need to get started. Please let me know of anything else that you may need from me in order to help make sure this program is a success. We provide you with a unique tracking URL that will track all orders that are placed.


LEAD GENERATION TRACKING URL:

Here is the landing page with your unique tracking number that will track the sales for you:
http://www.protectamerica.com/?agent={{ aff.affiliate.agent_id }}

If you have the need or desire for any sub-campaign tracking, you can use the following format for the URL:
http://www.protectamerica.com/?agent={{ aff.affiliate.agent_id }}&affkey=xxxx
To use the sub-campaign tracking, simply replace the "x"'s after the affKey= and that info will be passed along with that lead into our system. It will show up on your lead report and will let you know where your leads are coming from. If you have questions on the sub-campaign tracking please let us know right away.


CREATIVE RESOURCES:

The link below will take you to our affiliate resources page that has creatives, logos, banners, etc. that are approved and ready for use. If you have your own creative you would like to use, make sure to submit the material over to us for approval before implementing onto your site. Failure to do so can result in termination of contract.

TRACKING AND REPORTING:

To track the progress of the leads that get sent to us, you can visit http://www.protectamerica.com/reports
The reports page is NOT a real time tracking system. It updates every two hours during normal business hours. You will receive your username and password in a separate email.

Let me know if you need anything at all from me.


Sincerely,

Denise Shanklin
