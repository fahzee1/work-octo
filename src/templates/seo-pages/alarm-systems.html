Just take it out of the box, follow the simple directions and you’ll have the comfort of knowing your family is safe and your home is being monitored when you’re not around.</p>

This gives you an alarm system that will provide security to you and your family throughout the day, without the fear of potential intrusion or worrying about having stray wires all over the place.</p>

A wireless system with cellular monitoring on the other hand is much more difficult to disarm, making for a safer and more secure environment.</p>
