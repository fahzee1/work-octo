        <h1>Security Systems by Protect America</h1>
        
        <p>Security systems are becoming more popular every day while our national crime rates hover higher than they have in some time. Since burglaries occur every 14.6 seconds, many homeowners have decided to make their home safer and more secure with one of Protect America's alarm systems.</p>

        <h2>Five Sensor Types to Consider When Comparing Home Security Systems</h2>
        
        <p>Below we describe five types of sensors available for security systems including flood sensors, glass sensors, motion detectors (sensors) and smoke detectors. All these sensors play an important role in not only keeping you safe in the event of a home intrusion, but also play an important role in monitoring other dangers such as water and dangerous gasses.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Motion Detectors on Security Systems</strong> - The motion detectors that come with our systems detect heat AND motion when your security system is armed. Also, the motion detectors will not detect pets that weigh under forty pounds. This adds an additional layer of protection that is above and beyond expectations of a typical home security company.</li>
            <li><strong>Glass Break Sensor for Security Systems</strong> - Our glass break sensor is used specifically for detecting the sound of breaking glass within a 20 foot radius. When glass breaks it typically generates a sound below 20 hertz (Hz). The average window or door glass breaks at 3 to 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass it is and if a plastic layer is present. Our glass break sensor easily picks up on these waves, giving you peace of mind.</li>
            <li><strong>Low Temperature and Flood Sensor for Security Systems</strong> - For homes located in colder climates, installing what's know as a low temperature sensor to our security system will take an additional step and protect your pipes during the winter months! A flood sensor will lower the risk of flood damage by detecting water rising, before it can reach valuables.</li>
            <li><strong>Special Features for Security Systems</strong> - Protect America provides different features like a wireless secret keypad, solar powered yard sign lights, keychain remotes and a talking wireless keypad that allows you to arm or disarm your security system without having to be at the control panel.  Depending on which features you purchase it's reassuring to know that arming your security system is only a click away.</li>
            <li><strong>Smoke Detectors for Security Systems</strong> - In addition to a security system targeted at theft, we offer smoke detectors, heat sensors and carbon monoxide detectors. These are always being monitored regardless if your alarm is armed or disarmed. Adding this feature will protect your home and add an additional layer of protection for you and your family.</li>
        </ul>
