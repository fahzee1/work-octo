        <h2>Best Home Security Companies</h2>
        
        <p>Protect America, compared to the other home security companies that provide free
        equipment, has no installation charge and starts at only $29.99 per month for monitoring. Each of our five packages includes sensors for your doors and windows, however the number of sensors depends on which package you choose. All of our packages include 24-hour, seven-day-a-week home security monitoring and can include mobile capabilities as well.</p>
        
        <p>Below are three other home security companies that offer similar packages:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>FrontPoint Security</strong> - This company is the only other home security company that does not have an installation charge but their plans start at $99.99 for equipment and a minimum of $34.99 per month monitoring charge with a three-year contract. However, Protect America is the only home security company that truly gives you the equipment for free when you sign up for monitoring.</li>
          <li><strong>Vivint</strong> - This company is a mixture of home security, home automation and energy management so home security is not their core focus. We believe most consumers want to buy from an organization that specializes in home security because when it comes to your family or business, you only have one chance to get it right if there's an unfortunate event, and you want only the best in control.</li>
          <li><strong>ADT</strong> - ADT charges their customers at least $99 for installation and has a starting price of $42.99 per month. ADT only provides a wireless keypad, two door sensors, a motion detector and a wireless keychain remote with their starter package which is four times the price to get started with Protect America.
          </li>
        </ul>
