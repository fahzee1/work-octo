            <p>In order to install a home security system, you first need to know where you are going to place your sensors, how many additional features you want, and where you will install everything in your home.</p>
            
            <p>Protect America's basic home security system will consist of three sensors that can be placed on doors or windows. Usually this is for small apartments or lofts that have one door with two windows.</p>
            
            <p>A more complex home security system will include additional sensors synced to the control unit. Your control unit is the heart of your system since it reads all your sensors and detects intrusion while your system is armed. Additionally, if you have monitored smoke detectors, it will alert us of a fire regardless if your system is armed.</p>
            <div class="clear"></div>
