            <h2>Your Family Deserves the Best Protection</h2>
            <p>Protect America makes it easy to secure and protect your home and family. </p>

        <div class="home-security-content">
              
            <p>Studies show that over two million burglaries occur every year in the U.S. with an average loss of around $2,000. Protect America believes this is too much and that  everyone deserves to feel safe when entering and leaving their homes. The loss is more than a material loss, it's a loss of personal security and has long-term emotional implications. Protect America understands how important it is to prevent this type of life altering event and focuses on providing high quality <a href="http://www.protectamerica.com/home-security-blog/protect-america-2/ge-wireless-alarm-system_3695" title="GE home security systems">home security systems</a> that create a safe and secure environment for our customers.</p> 
              
            <p>Having an home security system is a huge step in securing your home but there are additional steps you can take to make it even safer and boost your alarm system's effectiveness at the same time. Adding dead bolts, properly placing exterior lighting around windows, garages and the path leading to your front door can deter thieves from breaking into your home. Unfortunately, no matter what you do, an experienced thief can break into your home regardless of what actions you take as long as they can do it in under 60 seconds. If you can increase the amount of time it takes for them to break in, you'll decrease the likelihood of them even trying. That's why it's so important to not only have a security system but take the extra steps necessary to make it even safer.</p>

            <h2>Taking the Extra Precautions for the Best Protection Possible</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="home-security-content">
            <p>Another effective step you can take is adding a highly visible "Beware of Dog" sign to an intruder's favorite spot, the back door. Your back door is usually the least visible from the public eye and is often less likely to be protected by an alarm. This is why in the owner's manual we suggest placing one of your sensors on the back door. Protect America knows little facts like this as well as many others, which is one reason nearly a half million families have trusted that we have the best home security system available.</p>
