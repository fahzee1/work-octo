    <h1>Home Alarm System by Protect America</h1>
     
    <p>Protect America provides a home alarm system that can include additional life saving features, such as a garage door sensor, smoke detectors, glass break sensors, low temperature sensors, flood sensors, keychain remote controls and medical panic pendants. All of these features are described below and will enhance your home alarm system.</p> 
     
    <p>Including a garage door sensor to your home alarm system will protect the biggest door in your house by sensing the tilt of the overhead door. This sensor will decrease the amount of time spent inside of your house, if the intruder were to come in through your garage, because your alarm would sound earlier before they got to your door. Sinse your home alarm system is already wireless adding this feature would be a great investment.</p> 
     
    <p>An additional feature that improves your home alarm system is a monitored smoke detector. Once you install Protect America smoke detectors, we will be able to notify your local fire department in case of a fire. This device is constantly connected to our monitoring facility regardless if your home alarm system is armed or not.</p> 
     
    <p>Some people have sliding glass doors and they often are concerned about an intrudor breaking the glass. Studies show this is one of the easiest doors to break into because it’s usually located in the back out of sight and can be easily removed from the sliding tracks. Protect America has a glass break sensor that will detect if anyone breaks the glass and the door sensor would detect if it were removed from the tracks. The glass break detector can detect the sound and vibration anytime a window or glass door is broken and covers a 20-foot radius. If you have a sliding glass door, this item is a must have for your home alarm system.</p> 
     
    <p>For our more northern states, with a colder climate, we provide a feature for low temperature. It notifies the center once your house drops below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. This allows for your home to be safe from pipes freezing, and allows you to be notified in the event your furnace stops working so you can prevent possible damage to your home. If you live in an area where flooding is a possibility we offer a flood sensor that will detect early stages of flooding to prevent damage to occur inside of your house.</p>   
     
    <p>Additionally, we’ve added features at your fingertips including a remote to place on your keychain that allows you to arm and disarm your home alarm system with the push of a button. Making it convenient for you as you leave or are coming into your home. Also on the keychain has a panic signal, which will notify the call center immediately in case you know of an emergency before your home alarm system sounds.</p> 
     
    <p>All of these are features that will enhance your home alarm system. Even though they may have additional charges, you never know which one could be the life-changing feature for your home alarm system.</p>
