    <h3>Arming Before Bed</h3>
    <p>Placing the wireless secret keypad in a drawer or the side of a nightstand gives you access to your system right before bed and when waking up in the morning. As you head to bed, make sure your system is locked and secured with a simple button press. Hear a crash in the night? With the optional X-10 components, use it as a convenient extra light switch to flip the lights on in the house.</p>

    <p>In case a burglar does enter your home, have a pre-planned location like a closet or even a panic room for you or your child to hide. Placing the secret keypad in this location will allow you to set off the alarm and send out a duress signal.</p>
