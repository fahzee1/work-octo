                    <p>Yale Real Living’s Z-Wave firmware is highly resistant to a security breach. Yale's wireless Z-Wave adapter sends information out over a 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES 128). AES 128 is the standard level of encryption for all modern Z-Wave devices, and is also used for things like military communications and online banking transactions.</p>

                  <h3>What if my phone gets lost or stolen?</h3>
                    <p>The SMART Connect app is the portal through which Protect America customers can remotely control their Yale Real Living locks. The most common concern is phones or other mobile devices on which SMART Connect is installed being lost or stolen. We strongly suggest users do the following:<br /><br />&bull; Keep devices password protected.<br />&bull; As a second measure of defense, users can turn off the “Auto Login” setting on the SMART Connect app login screen. This requires the user to manually input a password when opening the app instead of automatically being granted access.<br />&bull; Make sure you have the “Find My iPhone” app on your device. This will allow you to erase your device remotely or put it into “Lost mode” which will lock the device with a passcode. Android users can also do the same with <a href="http://wheresmydroid.com/" target="_blank" title="Find your Android phone is lost or stolen">http://wheresmydroid.com</a><br />&bull; If your phone or tablet is lost or stolen, you should immediately go to <a href="http://www.myprotectamerica.com" target="_blank" title="Login to SMART Connect">www.myprotectamerica.com</a> and  login to your SMART Connect account and change your password.<br /><br />This will prevent anyone from accessing your account from any device, even if you left the Auto Login setting turned on.
