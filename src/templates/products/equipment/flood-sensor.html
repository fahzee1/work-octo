            <h2>Wireless Security for Your Home.</h2>
            <p>A surprisingly simple device, door/window sensors create a magnetic field that, when broken, sends a signal to your central GE Simon XT control panel and sounds the alarm.</p>
            <p>Protect America only uses wireless sensors that can be used on either doors or windows, allowing for greater system customization. For most homes, we recommend one sensor for every accessible door and window.</p>

            <p>The most common piece of security equipment when it comes to securing your home, door or window sensors are used to detect when any door or window is opened.  Protect America uses wireless micro sensors to help keep them inconspicuous and out of the way. And we recommend a door / window sensor should be placed on any easily accessible door or window to attain a secure home perimeter.  </p>

				<h2>Know about a Problem, Before it Becomes a Catastrophe.</h2>
				<p>When a leak occurs, your flood sensor will warn you as soon as it senses the water.  Meaning you don't have to arrive home to find yourself knee-deep in water. And you can fix the problem quickly without costly repairs. So instead of having an aquarium, you can have a nice, dry basement. Add a flood sensor to any of our home security packages today.</p>
