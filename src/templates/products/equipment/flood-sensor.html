            <h2>Water Damage Can Be Costly.<span>Be Preventative And Get Flood Sensors</span> </h2>
            <p>The Flood Sensor is designed to discover any leakage in the part of your home or business that’s most susceptible to water and flooding.  With prompt notice it affords you ample space and time to salvage your valuables when you encounter problems with water damage and it saves you time and money.</p>
            <p>The Flood Sensor contains an 8-foot cord that is connected to the detector device. Once water is detected an alarm signal is transmitted.</p>
            <p>The transmitter in the flood sensor has a functional span (minimally) of 500 feet in free space (depending on location and the kind of control panel you have). The flood sensor battery will last about 3 to 5 years.</p>

				<h2>Know About A Problem,<span> Before It Becomes A Catastrophe.</span></h2>
				<p>When a leak occurs, your flood sensor will warn you as soon as it senses the water.  Meaning you don't have to arrive home to find yourself knee-deep in water. And you can fix the problem quickly without costly repairs. So instead of having an aquarium, you can have a nice, dry basement.
