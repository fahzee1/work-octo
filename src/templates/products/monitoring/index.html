        <h1>Alarm Monitoring Solutions</h1>
        <p>Having a home security system installed is just the first half of a secured home. When your alarm goes off, the security system sends out a signal to our monitoring station, which in turn, contacts you and the authorities. Without a home security monitoring service, an alarm that is tripped never contacts the police. Protect America firmly believes that having a monitored home security system is the best solution for keeping your home and family safe. And we are proud to offer a variety of monitoring solutions to fit your home, lifestyle, and budget.</p>

    <h2>How to Pick the Right Monitoring</h2>
    <p>In the past, the only option for monitoring a home security system was through a telephone line. While this is a reliable option that many customers still use, there are a growing number of households that, for one reason or the other, are choosing not to install a landline telephone service. While many alarm companies only offer this one type of monitoring solution, we understand the need for home alarm systems without a phone line. We believe that instead of changing your home to fit the alarm system, make your system fit your home. With today's communications technology, Protect America has created a variety of flexible home security system monitoring solutions. And we are proud to offer many different communication methods and affordable solutions to fit your needs. Read below for more information about our different types of service.</p>
