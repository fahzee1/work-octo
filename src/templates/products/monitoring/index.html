            <h2>What is Alarm Monitoring?</h2>
            <p>Having a home security system installed is just the first half of a secured home. When your alarm goes off, the security system sends out a signal to our monitoring station, which in turn, contacts you and the authorities. Without a home security monitoring service, an alarm that is tripped never contacts the police. A monitored home security system is the best solution for keeping your home and family safe. And we are proud to offer a variety of monitoring solutions to fit your home, lifestyle, and budget.</p>

            <h2>The Right Monitoring</h2>
            <p>While many alarm companies only offer one type of monitoring solution, we understand that every home is different. Not every monitoring solution will work with your home or budget. From cellular, high-speed broadband, or standard landline, we believe that instead of changing your home to fit the alarm system, make your system fit your home. With today's communications technology, Protect America has created a variety of affordable while also flexible home security system monitoring solutions.</p>
