        <h1>Landline Monitoring Connection</h1>
        <p>When choosing a landline connection, your GE control panel uses your standard landline telephone connection to communicate with our monitoring facility. This is the standard connection for most security systems. Anytime the security system is triggered, the command station sends a signal through the landline phone to our monitoring facility and notifies us about a problem in your home.
Depending on the nature of the problem, our monitoring facility will respond to your alarm and dispatch the emergency authorities to your home if necessary.</p>
