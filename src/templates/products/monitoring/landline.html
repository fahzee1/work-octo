		<h1>Standard Landline Alarm Monitoring</h1>
		<p>When choosing a landline connection, your GE control panel uses your landline telephone connection to communicate with our monitoring facility. For years, this has been the standard connection for most security systems and therefore, the most cost effective. Anytime the security system is triggered, the command station sends a signal through your phonelines to our monitoring facility and notifies us about a problem in your home.</p>
		<p>Depending on the nature of the problem, our monitoring facility will respond to your alarm and dispatch the emergency authorities to your home if necessary. Please visit the How It Works page to learn more on the steps we take when responding to an alarm at your home.</p>
