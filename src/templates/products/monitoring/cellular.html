            <h2>Cellular Monitoring</h2>
            <p>With our Cellular Monitoring Solution, you receive true flexibility for your home security monitoring service. There is no need for any type of landline home phone or internet connection. And since it is a cellular connection, the alarm system doesn't require any extra wires to work. Simply plug the command station into a power outlet and everything else is completely wireless. This service is not available in all areas and requires adequate cellular phone coverage in your area.</p>

    		<p>With Interactive Cellular Monitoring, your home security system works just like a cell phone. If the alarm goes off, authorities are notified without the need of a landline. This eliminates the opportunity for thieves to bypass your protection by simply cutting the wires that lead to your home.</p>

    		<h2>No Phone Line?<br />No Problem.</h2>
    		<p>These days, many people are giving up their home phone in place of a cell phone. But with most alarm systems, giving up your phone means giving up your protection - as they usually require a phone line to dial out to their monitoring station. We say, ditch the phone line and switch to cellular. Cellular monitoring means your alarm system will work just like a cell phone - wirelessly contacting our monitoring station during any sign of trouble.</p>
