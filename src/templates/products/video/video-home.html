        <h2>Get the Full, Clear, Unpixelated Picture</h2>
        <p>With traditional video cameras, you are stuck with a small fixed viewing area. And lower resolution cameras mean you get an unrecognizable, pixelated image. So when creating our home security video services, we built in pan and tilt capabilities with every camera. This allows you to control the lens, moving it side-to-side as well as up and down to "look" around a room. And we made sure you get a nice clear picture with up to 30 frames per second at 640x480 resolution.</p>
