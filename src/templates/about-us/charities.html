		<h2>The Austin Zoo</h2>
		<p>After finding a full-blooded timberland wolf pup on his property, our  CEO, Thad Paschall knew that this small animal would need a special  place to call home.  With more than 300 animals from more than 100 different species, the Austin Zoo was the perfect place.  Austin  Zoo is a private, non-profit zoo that rescues animals and serves the  Austin community. Here at Protect America, we were proud to have rescued  this wolf, affectionately named Joy, and to be involved in building a  large and lush wolf habitat for the Austin Zoo. Now, Joy and the other  wolves at Austin zoo have a safe place to play hide and seek while  enjoying the lazy days of summer.</p>
