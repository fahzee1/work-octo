        <h2>Pay It Forward</h2>
        <p>Protect America Cares (the charitable organization of home security company, Protect America, Inc.) recently teamed up with students at Michigan State University to raise money and awareness for charities in the Lansing area. Guided by advertising professor David Regan, the students were divided into 7 groups and given $500 seed money from Protect America to create marketing campaigns that help local charities improve fundraising.</p>

        <h2>The Austin Zoo</h2>
        <p>After finding a full-blooded timberland wolf pup on his property, our  CEO, Thad Paschall knew that this small animal would need a special  place to call home.  With more than 300 animals from more than 100 different species, the Austin Zoo was the perfect place.  Austin  Zoo is a private, non-profit zoo that rescues animals and serves the  Austin community. Here at Protect America, we were proud to have rescued  this wolf, affectionately named Joy, and to be involved in building a  large and lush wolf habitat for the Austin Zoo. Now, Joy and the other  wolves at Austin zoo have a safe place to play hide and seek while  enjoying the lazy days of summer.</p>
