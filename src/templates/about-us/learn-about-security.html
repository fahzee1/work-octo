    <h2>Why Choose a National Home Security Company?</h2>
    <p>In the market for a security system? You've been shopping around and comparing your options, but did you think to compare the size of the alarm companies you're considering? Not all alarm companies are equal when it comes to the quality and skill they promise.</p>
    <p>Ask yourself: Would you rather protect your home and family with a security system offered through a national home security company, or would you trust everything important in your life to the local home security shop around the corner? Before you buy, here are a few reasons why you should choose a national home security company.</p>
    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <p>A common misconception about home security is that going with a local alarm company is better. Many think that since there is a home security company locally, there is a local monitoring facility as well. In reality, when you sign up with a local home security company, they install it, and it ends up being monitored by a national monitoring facility anyway.</p>
    <h2>More products, more options</h2>
    <p>Protection isn't a homogenized need. Your home needs different safeguards than a small business, and national home security companies offer more <a href="http://www.protectamerica.com/pa/equipment" title="Protect America Alarm Companies | Specialized Products ">specialized products</a> and options than the local installer - not to mention diverse warranty plans.</p>

    <h2>Experience and stability</h2>
    <p>Choosing a national home security company means choosing experience and stability.  If the local guys go out of business, what do you end up with? No service, no warranty, and a lot of wasted time. National home security companies have a history, a large customer base, and a wealth of experience. Whatever your needs, they can help you.</p>

    <p>When you choose a home security company, make sure it's one you can trust - after all, you're placing your most valued items in its care.</p>
