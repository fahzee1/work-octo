            <p>Protect America, Inc. has our own internal "Do Not Call" list that we use to ensure that we are not making any unwanted phone calls to potential customers. If you had asked Protect America to contact you with information about our products and services and you are no longer interested in receiving phone calls from Protect America, please fill out the form below to have your number(s) added to our internal "Do Not Call" list. This will not include you on any Do Not Call list other than Protect America's internal list.</p>
