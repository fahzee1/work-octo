        <h1>Protect America Security of Information</h1>
        <h2>Computer Security Measures</h2>
        <p>At Protect America, we take your security very seriously, we value your trust, and understand that protecting your personal information is our most important responsibility. We have taken many important steps to ensure the security and integrity of your personal information.</p>
        <p>All of the pages that you provide your sensitive personal information to us are secure. The padlock icon found in most browsers will appear locked and the first characters of the website address will change from "http" to "https" if you are accessing a secure server which lets you know that your information is encrypted. If you have any questions regarding the security of your personal information, please call toll free 1-800-951-5111, extension 8247.</p>
        <p>You can trust that your information remains secure because our computer systems are protected in the following ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Secure Transmissions.</strong> This ensures that your information remains confidential. We use encryption technology, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" title="Protect America | Secure Socket Layer on Wikipedia" class="external" target="_blank">Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</a>, to transmit information between you and us. We use some of the strongest forms of encryption available to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery.  This protects your information in three key ways:
                <ul class="bulleted_list">
                    <li><strong>Authentication.</strong> This ensures that you are communicating with Protect America, and prevents other computers from impersonating us.</li>
                    <li><strong>Encryption.</strong> This scrambles transferred data so it cannot be read by unauthorized parties. From the moment information leaves your computer to the time it enters Protect America's system, all online access and sessions are encrypted. During any transaction, our encryption turns your information into code with billions of possible variations to make it secure. Once we receive the information, our computer systems decipher the code back into meaningful information so that we can complete your request. Only Protect America authorized individuals are allowed to access the information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Integrity.</strong> This verifies that the information you send to us is not altered during the transfer. The system detects if data was added, deleted, or altered after you sent the message.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Anti-Virus Protection.</strong> This detects and prevents viruses from entering our computer network systems. In addition, every email we send and receive is scanned by two systems before the message is transmitted and each individual computer is protected with it's own anti-virus protection.</li>
            <li><strong>Firewalls.</strong> This blocks unauthorized access by individuals or networks. Firewalls are one way we protect our computer systems that interact with the Internet.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy Policy.</strong> This lets you know what we do with your information once we have it. Your privacy is extremely important and our <a href="http://www.protectamerica.com/pa/priv_p" title="Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a> is TRUSTe<sup>Â®</sup> certified for your protection.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Credit Approval Process</h2>
        <p>A basic credit check is required for approval when ordering your security system online or from one of our representatives. In order to protect your identity, Protect America requires your social security number to check your credit through Equifax and in some cases Trans Union. Our security of information policies listed above ensure that your information is safe and secure.</p>
        <p>Our online credit check process uses Equifax Decision Power. When you enter your information on Step 2 of the ordering process and click the "Next" button, your encrypted information is transmitted through the Equifax system to review your credit. We recommend entering your information as well as that of your spouse/co-applicant when you are submitting your order.</p>
        <p>If your credit is instantly declined, an onscreen message will appear informing you that you are unable to proceed with the online process due to information in your credit report. If you are instantly approved, the system will allow you to proceed with your order and will notify you at the end that your order has been approved. In some cases, the credit decision is not able to be made instantly and needs to be reviewed by a certified credit professional. If that does occur, the system will allow you to proceed and we will inform you that the order is being reviewed. Once a credit decision is made, you will receive an email that will update you on the status of your order.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions regarding the Credit Approval Process, please call toll free 1-800-951-5111, extension 8247.</p>
        <h2>Payment Information</h2>
        <p>When you place your order online, Protect America accepts Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. Your credit card information is used to pay for your total due at the time of your order and it will also be used to automatically pay your monthly monitoring bill each month. Our security of information policies listed above ensure that your information is safe and secure. If you would like to change the credit card used for your monthly payments, simply call 1-800-951-5111, Option 3.</p>
