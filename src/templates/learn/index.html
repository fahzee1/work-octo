        <h2>Why Choose a National Home Security Company?</h2>
        <p>In the market for a security system? You've been shopping around and comparing your options, but did you think to compare the size of the alarm companies you're considering? Not all <a href="http://www.protectamerica.com/home-security-blog/home-security-companies-2/affordable-home-security-companies_2759" title="alarm companies">alarm companies</a> are equal when it comes to the quality and skill they promise.</p>
        <h2>The Basics</h2>
        <p>A common misconception about home security is that going with a local alarm company is better. Many think that since there is a home security company locally, there is a local monitoring facility as well. In reality, when you sign up with a local home security company they install it, and it ends up being monitored by a national monitoring facility. Make sure to check if your home security company has redundant back-up monitoring. Protect America uses three of the best monitoring facilities throughout the United States to make sure your home is always protected.</p>
        <p>It is also important to note that Protect America offers three different types of monitoring options to fit your needs and budget. Many smaller companies offer only one type of monitoring. Before choosing a home security company, make sure the system will actually work with your home. For example, a landline monitored system only works if you currently have a home telephone line.

        <h2>More products, more options</h2>
        <p>Protection isn't a homogenized need. Your home needs different safeguards than a small business, and national home security companies offer more <a href="{% url equipment %}" title="Protect America Alarm Companies | Specialized Products ">specialized products</a> and options than the local installer - not to mention lifetime equipment warranties.</p>
    
        <h2>Experience and stability</h2>
        <p>Choosing a national home security company means choosing experience and stability.  If the local guys go out of business, what do you end up with? No service, no warranty, and a lot of wasted time. This is exactly what happened to <a href="http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/21926865/alarm-companys-closing-confuses-customers" target="_blank" title="Hawaii Alarm Closes and Confuses Customers">Hawaii Alarm Customers</a>.

        <h2>Most Importantly...</h2>
        <p>When you choose a home security company, make sure it's one you can trust - after all, you're placing your most valued items in its care.</p>
