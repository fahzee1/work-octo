        <blockquote>My husband and I purchased the Protect America Home Security System. We had the pleasure of working with William McClure for the installation. He was very polite and professional and helped us with all of our questions. We were very impressed with William and wanted to give him positive feedback. We have been long time customers of ADT. We researched other companies and Protect America beat out all of the other competition for price and service. Thank you.<p>MELISSA OF GARDENDALE, AL</p></blockquote>
