            <p>It's important to plan where you will place your new Simon XT home security system and the sensors that come with it. Depending on what type of monitoring you have, whether it is landline, broadband, or cellular, you will need to place the base of the Simon XT in a place that it will connect to your monitoring source. One you have planned where your actual system will go it is important to know how many sensors you need for each entry point such as doors and windows. It is also important to plan out other important home security devices that come with a Simon XT such as smoke detectors, CO2 monitors, glass break sensors, motion detectors and more. Keep a good count of what devices you need and plan where you will place each one to make sure you get the most of out your new home security system.</p>
            <p>When you receive your new Simon XT system it?s time to prepare. You will need take all of the equipment out of the box and place all pieces in front of you. Each piece of equipment is actually pre-labeled with a specific number which indicates where in the actual Simon XT it is programmed. A good idea is to create a list with the specific number it is labeled as and name it according to which location you plan on placing the sensor. This will save a lot of time during the installation process with your technician over the phone. Make sure you do not place your sensors or install your system up before calling.</p>

            <p>Once you have created your list of sensors, you are ready to call your home security company to install your whole system. Your Simon XT has a battery in the back that needs to be connected before you plug it into the actual electrical power. You need to clip in two white clips located in the back by the bottom of the Simon XT. Once you connect the system, it will power on and you will hear a beep from the system turning on. Now you can connect it to an electrical source. If you got broadband monitoring you will connect it to a router or modem. If you have a landline system you will need to connect it to a phone jack. Also, if you have a cellular system you will need to place it strategically in the home, where you happen to have the best reception. Your technician will then walk you through installing the rest of your system.</p>

        <div class="activate-para">
            <p>After installing your Simon XT and all pieces of equipment your technician will walk you through testing every part of your system to ensure they are working. To activate your system, your technician will help you take your account off of test and activate it with the monitoring station. This means from that point on the monitoring station will start to receive real signals from your home security system. </p>
