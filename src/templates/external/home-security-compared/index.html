When it comes to your <span>monthly monitoring rate</span>, you want to make sure you are paying a price that is affordable and is reasonable. Some home security companies actually can raise your monthly cost at any time. It is important you are protected and understand what you will be paying monthly. We also compare <span>warranty costs</span>. Your warranty is extremely important as you do not want to be paying out of pocket costs for repairs or replacement parts in the future. You deserve great home security so we're here to help!</p>
