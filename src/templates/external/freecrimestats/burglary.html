                    <h3>Burglary</h3>
                    <p>Burglary (also called breaking and entering or sometimes housebreaking) is a crime, the essence of which is illegal entry into a building for the purposes of committing an offence. Usually that offence will be theft, but most jurisdictions specify others which fall within the ambit of burglary.</p>
                    <p>Burglary can be one of the most intrusive crimes. Not only does a burglar invade your personal space, but a lot of times they take items that are most important to you or family. Most things can be replaced such as electronics and material items, but a burglary really affects a family when they take items that truly mean something. </p>
                    <p>Avoid becoming a victim of burglary by protecting your home before it happens. Set your home up with a <a href="http://www.protectamerica.com?agent=i10054" target="_blank">home security system</a> to strategically protect your home from intruders. Place sensors on all doors, windows, and any accessible entry points. Speak to your home security provider to find recommendations customized to layout of your home. Place a home security yard sign in your front yard so that it is visible to anyone crossing or watching your home. Homes with security systems are less likely to be broken into.</p>
