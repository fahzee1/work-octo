                    <h3>Motor Vehicle Theft</h3>
                    <p>Motor vehicle theft (sometimes referred to as grand theft auto by the media and police departments in the US) is the criminal act of stealing or attempting to steal a motor vehicle (such as an automobile, truck, bus, coach, motorcycle, or snowmobile, trailer).</p>
                    <p>Always park your vehicle where it can be seen from a window of your home or near a street light. Motor vehicle thefts usually tend to happen in crowded unsupervised parking lots, dark streets or neighborhoods with low person activity. It's important to realize motor vehicle theft can happen at any-time and anywhere. You can also purchase a <a href="http://www.protectamerica.com/pa/vehicle-gps-tracking/gps-services?agent=i10054" target="_blank">GPS</a> device to track your vehicle if it?s ever stolen.</p>
