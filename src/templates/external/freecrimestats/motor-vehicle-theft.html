                    <h2>What is Motor Vehicle Theft?</h2>
                    <p>Motor vehicle theft (sometimes referred to as grand theft auto by the media and police departments in the US) is the criminal act of stealing or attempting to steal a motor vehicle (such as an automobile, truck, bus, coach, motorcycle, or snowmobile, trailer).</p>
                    <p>Motor vehicle theft happens too often to be ignored. Some people only have liability insurance, so when their car is stolen, it’s a complete total loss. {% content_spinner "motor1" "Too often|All too often|A lot of times" %} people carry valuable items in their vehicle so the loss of their car may be even more.</p>
                    <h2>Prevent your Car Being Stolen in {{ city }}, {{ state_long }}</h2>
                    <p>You might not be able to stop a criminal from stealing your car if you’re not looking but there are a few things you can do to {% content_spinner "motor2" "avoid|defend|stop" %} your vehicle from becoming a target. You can park in a well-lit area. You can also avoid leaving valuables out in the open on your seats, such as laptops, navigation adapters, and other items that may be of interest to vandals.</p>
                    <p>A good and cost efficient way to avoid losing your vehicle completely can be something as simple as placing a monitored GPS device on your vehicle. these small devices allow you to track your vehicle on your phone or computer. It also provides alerts if your car has left a preset area or is above a set speed limit.</p>
