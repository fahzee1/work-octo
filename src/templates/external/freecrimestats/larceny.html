                    <p>Burglary (also called breaking and entering or sometimes housebreaking) is a crime, the essence of which is illegal entry into a building for the purposes of committing an offense. Usually that offense will be theft, but most jurisdictions specify others which fall within the ambit of burglary.</p>
                    <p>Burglary can happen to anyone at any time. Burglary can be one of the most intrusive crimes. Not only does a burglar invade your personal space, but a lot of times they take items that are most important to you or family. Most things can be replaced such as electronics and material items, but a burglary really affects a family when they {% content_spinner "fcs2" "destroy items|steal irreplaceable items|take heirlooms|destroy family heirlooms" %} that truly mean something. It’s important to {% content_spinner "burglary1" "protect|secure|get security for" %} your home and be prepared at all times no matter what the situation is.</p>
