                    <h3>Violent Crime</h3>
                    <p>A violent crime or crime of violence is a crime in which the offender uses or threatens to use violent force upon the victim. This entails both crimes in which the violent act is the objective, such as murder, as well as crimes in which violence is the means to an end, (including criminal ends) such as robbery. Violent crimes include crimes committed with weapons. With the exception of rape (which accounts for 6% of all reported violent crimes), males are the primary victims of all forms of violent crime.</p>
                    <p>Violent crime is to be taken serious and treated with extreme care. Consult with your local police department and authorities if you are ever the victim of a violent crime. It's important to know your rights and to not be afraid to speak up. No one deserves to be treated with violence.</p>
