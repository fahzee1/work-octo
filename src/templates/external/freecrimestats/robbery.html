                    <h3>Robbery</h3>
                    <p>Robbery is the crime of taking or attempting to take something of value by force or threat of force or by putting the victim in fear. At common law, robbery is defined as taking the property of another, with the intent to permanently deprive the person of that property, by means of force or fear.</p>
                    <p>In a robbery, every situation is different. A lot of times your life is threatened or there can be a risk of one being injured. The most important thing is to be calm in whatever the situation may be. If you have the chance, dial or call the proper authorities in the given opportunity depending on your circumstances.</p>
