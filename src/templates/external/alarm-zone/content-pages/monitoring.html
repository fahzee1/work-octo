                    <h3>Landline Monitoring</h3>
                    <p>Landline monitoring is the most common type of monitoring but also the oldest.

                    <h3>Broadband Monitoring</h3>
                    <p>Broadband monitoring is when your alarm system is connected using your router or connection for your internet. Broadband is actually the quickest form of home security monitoring and sends a signal to the monitoring station almost instantly when an alarm is triggered. With most people getting rid of their home phone, this is a perfect option if you only have internet at home.</p>

                    <h3>Cellular Monitoring</h3>

                    <p>Cellular monitoring is the newest and most up to date way of securing your home. With cellular monitoring there is no need for a home phone, internet, or any wiring. Simply connect your cellular monitored security system to power, and it will automatically send signals as long as you are in a covered area. Cellular monitoring is powered by a GSM module built inside the actual alarm system which communicates with the monitoring station wirelessly. Itâ€™s the new way of protecting your home.</p>
