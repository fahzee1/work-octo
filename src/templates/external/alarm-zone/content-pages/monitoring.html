                    <p>When looking for the right security alarm system to offer from our website, AlarmZone wanted to make sure that the alarm system monitoring service included flexible options. Many people today are using VOIP phone service or only using their cellular phones which means they do not have a landline phone service in their homes.

                    <p>At AlarmZone, we feel that we have exceeded the challenge with our GE security alarm system offer. We found the only security offer in the nation for the GE wireless security alarm system that gives customers the ability to choose between a landline connection or a brand new alternative, the Broadband Internet connection.

                    <p>The Broadband Internet connection allows customer without a landline phone to still be able to provide protection to their homes and families by connecting the security alarm system directly into any available port on the high-speed internet router.

                    <p>The best part about the offer we found is that it offers the most flexible options at the most affordable price. Fill out the form on the right to have a representative contact you today with all the details!
