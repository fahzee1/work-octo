            Protect America is committed to excellence and affordability when it comes to securing
            your home. That's why we're a Consumers Digest Best Buy&trade; for home security and the best

        <h3>Home Security Value</h3>
        <p>
            The average yearly home insurance premium in the U.S. costs over $800. The good news is that
            many plans offer discounts up to 20% on home insurance for homes with security systems. You
            could save $14 or more per month on your insurance with a <a href='{% url gold %}' title="Learn More about the Gold Home Security Package">GE home alarm system</a>. For many, 
            the monthly cost of a Protect America GE home security system would be less than $16 per
            month once a home insurance discount is applied. For 50 cents a day, you can have the peace
            of mind knowing that your family and home will have the extra protection of a residential
            security system. Our wireless GE home security system is one investment you can't afford to 
            ignore.

            2007 FBI Crime Statistics:

            <li>Each year in the United States, a burglary occurs every 14 seconds.</li>

            <li>

                In more than a third of all burglaries, the burglar enters the front door (and most of the time 
                does so forcefully).
            </li>
            <li>
                Homes without a monitored security alarm system are 3 times more likely to be burglarized or 
                robbed than those with a monitored home security system.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is sufficient evidence to show that in the past, when the economy has suffered, burglary 
                and property crime has increased in parallel.
