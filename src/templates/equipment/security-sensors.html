        <h2>Door / Window Entry Point Sensors</h2>
        <p>Wireless door and window sensors are the most common piece of home security equipment. They are interchangeable and can be used as a door sensor or as window alarm sensors. When an intruder opens any door or window, the sensor detects the change and triggers the alarm.</p>

    <h2>Motion Detectors</h2>
    <p>Our Motion Detectors use both heat and movement to detect intruders when your alarm system is armed. They are very useful in case someone does enter your home. Therefore, a motion detector is best placed in a heavy traffic area of your home.</p>
    <h3>Motion Detector Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Each Motion Detector protects within a 25 ft. range in a 90 degree arc</li>
        <li>Designed with pets in mind - won't detect animals up to 40 lbs., reducing false alarms</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Garage Door Sensors</h2>
    <p>This sensor protects against entry though the biggest door in your house. By detecting the tilt of an overhead door, this sensor can alert your alarm system if your garage is opened while armed.</p>
    <h3>Garage Door Sensor Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All of our sensors are wireless so protecting your garage door couldn't be easier</li>
