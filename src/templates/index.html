			<h2>Protect America Home Security</h2>
			<h3><a name="security systems for home">Home Security Commitment</a></h3>

			    Protect America is committed to excellence and affordability when it comes to securing
			    your home. That's why we're a Consumers Digest Best Buy for home security and the best

			<h3>Home Security Value</h3>
			<p>
			    The average yearly home insurance premium in the U.S. costs over $800. The good news is that
			    many plans offer discounts up to 20% on home insurance for homes with security systems. You
			    could save $14 or more per month on your insurance with a GE home alarm system. For many, 
			    the monthly cost of a Protect America GE home security system would be less than $16 per
			    month once a home insurance discount is applied. For 50 cents a day, you can have the peace
			    of mind knowing that your family and home will have the extra protection of a residential
			    security system. Our wireless GE home security system is one investment you can't afford to 
			    ignore.

			<h3>Home Security Statistics</h3>
			<p>
			    <strong>Facts about Burglary, Property Crimes, and Home Security Alarms</strong>
			    <br>
			    2007 FBI Crime Statistics:
			</p>
	
			<ul>
			    <li>Each year in the United States, a burglary occurs every 14 seconds.</li>
			    <li>Most burglaries occur during the day between 6am and 6pm.</li>
			    <li>The average residential burglary victim lost $1,991.</li>

			<ul>
			    <li>
			        In more than a third of all burglaries, the burglar enters the front door (and most of the time 
			        does so forcefully).
			    </li>
			    <li>
			        Homes without a monitored security alarm system are 3 times more likely to be burglarized or 
			        robbed than those with a monitored home security system.
			    </li>
			    <li>
			        There is sufficient evidence to show that in the past, when the economy has suffered, burglary 
			        and property crime has increased in parallel.
