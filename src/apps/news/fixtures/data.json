Summer is well-known throughout public safety and security communities as the peak time for home invasions. To combat this rise in area crime, Colquitt County Sheriff's Office will hold classes on home and personal safety, the Moultrie Observer reported.<br/><br/>A variety of safety measures can be learned from these classes. Because firearm protection will be taught in these free seminars, all participants must be over 21 years old. &quot;These training seminars will cover realistic and legal ways to protect your home and property, as well as ways to protect yourself and family while at home and away from home,&quot; the Observer said. &quot;Discussions will also include home security measures and personal security measures, with the main emphasis being on crime prevention.&quot;<br/><br/>In addition to attending a firearms protection seminar, people may want to consider taking a personal defense course as a measure against a possible home invasion or other attack.<img alt=\"ADNFCR-3514-ID-19923894-ADNFCR\" src=\"http://feeds.directnews.co.uk/feedtrack/justcopyright.gif?feedid=3514&itemid=19923894\" />", "brafton_id": 19923894, "date_created": "2010-08-11 15:00:05", "summary": "Georgia's Moultrie-Colquitt County has seen a recent rise in violent crimes and theft, which has led public officials to hold safety seminars for its residents.", "image_caption": null, "categories": [1]}}, {"pk": 35, "model": "news.article", "fields": {"image": "", "heading": "Preventing a home invasion", "content": "When it comes to protecting a person's property, there are certain preventive measures that can be taken.<br/><br/>While nothing is 100 percent effective, some safety tips help reduce the risk of a home invasion, the Calderon Enterprise reported.

The gang got its name by using a BMW with Bond-worthy gadgets to evade police.<br/><br/>It is known for targeting wealthy neighborhoods and stealing anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 worth of valuables, such as jewels and cash. The burglars, wearing ski masks so they cannot be identified by security cameras, can complete a robbery in the few minutes between activating a security alarm and the arrival of the police.<br/><br/>The James Bond gang is suspected in connection with upwards of 40 burglaries that have been committed in the New York /New Jersey area since 2009. A police task force, formed to investigate the crimes, arrested three men in North Jersey in April 2011.

Cameras can be installed with the intention of being obviously visible to deter potential burglars. However, vandal-proof cameras are typically smaller and less noticeable and may be more effective at catching bold burglars who might attempt to destroy more obtrusive cameras.<br/><br/>Some security cameras are specifically designed to withstand the elements of the outdoors, but environmental housings can be installed to protect other cameras from harsher weather.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.homesecuritysystemsadvice.com/fake-security-cameras.aspx\">Home Security Advice</a> states that homes that have no security measures are 10 times more likely to be targeted by burglars. Installing fake security cameras can be an alternative to using functioning cameras, because no additional security monitoring equipment is required. Burglars may think twice about approaching a home or business with cameras, although only real cameras will be any use in the event of an actual break-in.<br/><br/>Replica cameras can also be used in conjunction with functioning cameras to make an establishment appear more secure without spending as much money. Functioning cameras with 3.6mm lenses can capture a wider image than an inexpensive, 6mm lens. The extra cost of a lens with a better scope of vision can be counteracted by installing fewer real cameras and adding in a few fakes.&nbsp;<br/><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>This article is brought to you by Protect America - the leading distributor of state-of-the-art GE Wireless <a href=\"http://www.protectamerica.com\">Home Security Systems</a>.
