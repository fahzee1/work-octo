Dianne,,Orangeburg,SC,"""I have been a Protect America customer for four years. I am a nurse, so I work long shifts and I depend on my alarm system to keep my house safe when I am away. I never thought it could happen to me, but while I was at work, in broad daylight, an intruder tried to break into my house. They busted down the back door, but before they could even step foot into my house, the alarm scared them away. I was called immediately at work and the police were dispatched right away. Nothing was taken, and no one was harmed.<br />
Thank you Protect America for protecting my home, my belongings, and my family.""

Amanda,,Sparks,NV,"""Your home is supposed to be your sanctuary. The place you feel the most safe, yet for many victims of domestic violence, it is where you are at greatest risk. Most people need a home security system to keep strangers out. I needed one to keep my ex-husband out. Someone who once lived here, someone who knows the layout of this house better than any stranger trying to break in.  I knew if he got into the house, it could cost me my life, or even worse, my childrens' lives.
<br/>

I needed a comprehensive system that left no gaps in protection. I searched online and looked at several home security systems.  When I found Protect America & used their online comparison chart to compare their services & features with those of other companies, it was very clear that Protect America had the best coverage plan for my needs. I purchased the Platinum System because I knew I wouldn't feel comfortable with anything less. 
<br/>

I placed a call to Protect America and the ordering process was very easy. I particularly liked that my sales representative was very thorough in helping me understand all the areas of my home that could be used to gain access into the home.  Due to severity of my situation, my system was expedited & shipped immediately.  I installed it myself when it arrived the next day and the installation was very easy, especially since their technicians stay on the line with you throughout the entire process, walking you through every step of the way. After the system has been installed they test each sensor & device to ensure proper installation and protection.
<br/>

With Protect America, I feel as safe as I possibly can given my situation. When your life is being threatened I don't think you ever get that feeling of being completely safe at all times, but now I can walk in my door, close it, lock it & engage the alarm system and feel safer than I ever could without their system. Finally, I can sleep again at night knowing I am protected.
<br/>

Thank you Protect America!""

""I am a 59 year-old man on an oxygen machine and I was slicing tomatoes getting supper ready and when I turned around my smoke detector was going off and my entire house was filling with smoke.  The whole skillet was on fire and the smoke detector with my security system went off.  Within minutes, the fire department was there to rescue me without me even having to call.  I am now getting a second security system for my cabin.  I would not trade companies if my life depended on it.  Protect America took care of me.""

Anne,,Austin,TX,"""Rarely do I have the opportunity to write a letter complementing an employee for providing exemplary customer service. Seldom have I had problems with my alarm system but recently a complicated problem arose. When I called the service department, Terrell Hunt was assigned to assist me.""<br/>

I am not technical or mechanical but Ms. Huntâ€™s depth of knowledge, patience, and focus enabled me to make changes to the infinitely confusing circuit board, which I never would have attempted, especially over the phone. Today we finished troubleshooting the system, which is now running perfectly.<br/>

Without Ms. Huntâ€™s expertise, professionalism and great attitude this could have been the typical experience of calling any companyâ€™s â€œserviceâ€ department only to meet with far more frustration than help.<br/>

Please recognize Ms. Hunt for her outstanding performance throughout the lengthy repair process.<br/>",2009-11-02 14:38:33

""Thank you to Protect America! I have been sleeping better. On September 29, 2006, 4 men broke into my house. They stole everything that you can imagine, even toys, clothes, and shoes from my children. My family and I were so scared to be home after that, I started to look into security systems and everything was really up in the sky for us money wise. But I called Protect America and got the best deal and since that night we sleep like little babies.

THANK YOU PROTECT AMERICA!""

Jonathan,,Kannapolis,NC,"""My family and I went to bed in June of 2005 expecting a good night's rest.  At 11:45 PM the alarm sounded.  We jumped out of bed to see what was going on and to my surprise, I found my back door standing open.  I got my children and stayed in our bedroom until the police arrived.  Due to the fact that we had an alarm system, the intruders were scared off by the sirens and did not enter the house.  I know for a fact that someone's life was saved by the alarm system that night.  Most people will go to any means necessary to protect their families and this is the best way to start.  I wouldn't live in a home without an alarm system.""<br/>",2009-11-02 14:38:33

I have been a law enforcement officer for 13 years now and lately there has been a rash of thefts and burglaries that I take reports on everyday. I finally broke down and bought this system. It is everything I could ask for and more. The system is easy to use and I am very impressed that my cat, who likes to jump on everything, has not set off any of our motion sensors. That was one of my biggest fears because I did not want any false alarms. The wireless was very important to me also because I did not want wires drilled everywhere. My window and door sensors are great. They leave enough play room that I could put them anywhere and they never fail. I was worried that the sensor and magnet would have to be right on top of each other to work but they have plenty of play room and never fail. I mounted my window sensors on top of the windows and not on the sliding side part. Your price was what hooked me into buying your product over ADT. I spent the extra money and bought 20 window and door sensors and 2 motion detectors along with the key ring and the portable talking base unit for upstairs. All worth the money.""<br/>",2009-11-02 14:38:33

Daryel,,Detroit,MI,I am very big on customer service and I must say I am very pleased with the customer service I received from Mike.   I was impressed because he wasn't aggressive.  He gave good reasons to why I should get the security system but when I insisted that I needed to finish my own checking because that is who I am.  I tend to be cautious about things I sign. Mike listened and explained to me about the promotion but still didn't push.  I hate when people push - for me its a turn off and I have no problem hanging up.  Why! Because it is going to be my responsibility for payment and to honor my part of the contract agreement.  I did call back and requested him because of his ability to handle the phone call without frustration. He is the kind of sales person I prefer to work with.  I have recommended another person to him. Thank you for excellent customer service personnel. Customers build a company but customer service representatives build your customer base.  Thank again!!,2009-11-10 16:23:12

Christopher,,Monterey,CA,"I was looking for the BEST home security system and ""googled"" 'Who makes the best home security system'. Your company was displayed with others (some nationally known) and yours was the ONLY one with a Five-Star rating. I went through your website and read all the FAQ's. I was convinced your system was the right one. I placed the order on Wednesday (11/11/09), received it on Thursday, 11/12/09 and installed it on Saturday 11/14/09. Everybody from the sales department (Antoinette), to the installation tech (Jeff) and the QA representative (Janet) far exceeded my expectations. I've never dealt with a company that had it SO TOGETHER with something that could (potentially) be so difficult. The installation, verification and commissioning of the system was amazingly simple (and I understand that our system was more complex than the typical). We started off with 29 sensors and I added five more at the end of the commissioning. I was blown away at the customer service attitude of EVERYBODY I talked with and their comprehensive knowledge of the entire system. Not only this, but your system is extremely simple to install and operate. You've got a customer for life!

He was on the phone with me close to an hour, going over everything.  One of my keypads was not working. He then re-programmed it for me.  My husband and I are very happy to know that people like Gus are part of the Protect America Team. I told him I would need to be ordering a motion detector and 1 door detector and 2 key chains.

Just wanted to drop you a quick e-mail to praise one of your sales reps. Donovan was knowledgeable of the products, professional and helped me make some decisions on what to add to my system above the base package. I have had other security systems over the years and got nowhere near the customer service and patience he provided from those organizations.  I am telling all my friends about Protect America, one for the excellent prices and product packages you have, but also because of the great experience I had as Donovan led me through the process ensuring I was getting all of the products I needed for the best price. Please extend my thanks to him again as he is a great first impression of your company.

Bryan,&,St Louis,MO,"I was so completely overwhelmed with the thought of going and doing the install myself that I called about canceling my service within the 7 days.  I spoke with Zakieh and she really put me at ease and helped immensely.  She was a life saver.  I will tell you that I have been severely unimpressed by a lot of the customer service I have received from businesses these days.  And I have had some of the best customer service ever from Protect America.  Even when they thought I wanted to cancel.  That is impressive and a wonderful breath of fresh air these days.  I just want to ask that Zakieh in cancellations be personally thanked on my behalf.  I would call back and thank her, but wouldn't want to clog up the lines from customers needing her help.  Thank you so much!!


I just left great feedback for Zakieh but couldn't leave without also giving a wonderful review for Joseph and Chez whose last name I missed.  They were also extremely helpful.  Joseph walked me through the installation process and made it so very easy for me.  I am by far not the handiest person around.  But he made sure that I got every step before moving on.  He was a great help.  And Chez went through the system with me again making sure that everything had been set up and was working.  He answered more questions I had and was very pleasant.  In fact all of the people I spoke to with this company A.J. my sales man, Zakieh, Joseph  and Chez were all well above average for any customer service I have seen recently.  And I am thankful that a company has finally decided to make customer service a priority.  I felt like they really ""wanted to help"" me and that was a change for the better.  So thank you Protect America.  Also, your online feature for my alarm system is incredible and I absolutely love it.  I am very impressed thus far. Thanks!!!

James,,Levittown,PA,"Dear Mr. Paschall
Just wanted to say thank you for customer service people like Sharon. For the first time in three years my equipment needed service because of a blinking light. I had installed this system myself and really forgot how to do anything but arm and disarm the system. Sharon walked me through getting the system back up and tested out like a pro. It was clear she knew every nuance of the system. Even some I had never new were there. She was polite and articulate. She even sounded like Paula Dean from the food network. What a joy to deal with. 
I am more secure than ever with my Protect America alarm!

Gorya,,Lancaster,TX,"Donovan was an excellent sales rep. After a couple of minutes of talking with him, I felt more at ease and willing to listen more to what he had to say. He was very knowledgeable about the system, the cost, and NO HIDDEN FEES. The process was smooth, simple, and to the point. I didn't feel obligated to sign up or pressured in any way to buy this system. I feel like, I finally found the alarm system that met MY needs, not the company's. Donovan was VERY patient and courteous. I still can't believe it was that simple. He offered me everything I was looking for BEFORE I had to ask. EXCELLENT sales rep--need more like him EVERYWHERE!!!  Great customer service and representative of your company throughout and its product. THANK YOU!!",2010-06-02 13:47:15

Claude,,St Louis,MO,"We all have experienced being in the ""wrong line"" for service.  This was not the case this morning, as I needed to add my motion detector to my system.  After adding a security sign for my lawn, updating my call-up list, Latoria walked me through the routine.  I not only added the motion detector but also tested the complete system.  She was pleasant, understanding, PATIENT, and an enjoyment to talk to.  I learned of not only my system, but also other newer systems available and additional features now available.  I've had the other competitors systems BUT this was the first time that the entire system was checked and the updates were done.  I expected a nightmare and received a dream!  Thank you for providing a format that allows your customers to evaluate your level of service.

I would like to give your monitoring crew and the young lady I talked to a big Thank You for a great and professional job. On July 5, 2010 at approximately 2:00 PM I received a call via cell phone that detected a back door alarm. At that time I was 300 miles from home on a mini vacation with my wife. Your representative asked the appropriate information and after I informed her of the situation I asked her to call my second, which was done immediately. The neighbor, my second, told her to keep the authorities coming and they would investigate. On that day FRUITA, had some very high gusty winds and upon investigating found the wind had blown the back door open enough to open the contacts. All this was relayed to me with in 20 minutes. What a relief! The door was secured and the system reset by my neighbor and myself over the telephone. I have nothing but great things to say about your security system, monitoring station and the tech support we have received. Thanks Again!
Respectfully,
Danny

From my first contact trying to get a feel for what your coverage entails and what the cost would be I received what I felt were honest and sincere answers to my questions.  There was no BS or unwanted sales pitches at any time. The other companies I contacted refused to answer any of my questions unless I gave them personal information i.e. email address home phone etc. This really put me off. Your people were upfront and your approach is very refreshing. Another thing that impressed was ten minutes after I signed for the delivered system one of your representatives called and was ready to help me with the installation.

Tanya,,York,PA," Good morning.  Yesterday I had the pleasure of speaking to Robert in regards to a new security system.  Last week our home was burglarized and he was so supportive, sympathetic and ready to get our house secure.  I researched several different security companies and found that Protect America had the best deals by far! Robert was extremely knowledgeable and patient every step of the way until we completed the service agreement.  I have already spoken to people asking that if, in the future, they are ever thinking about a security system to call Protect America.  After a home burglary, sense of security is almost always shattered.  After speaking with Robert and getting my service, I can now work on getting our lives back in order.  Thank you so very much.

When the system arrived I called him and he assisted me in installing and setting up the system.  Due to his expertise and precise instructions I was able to have the system up and running in a ""snap"".  This was important to me because my husband was working out of town and I live in a sparsely populated area outside of the city limits.  Art made sure the system was shipped quickly and was available for immediate setup upon arrival.  I was extremely impressed with his competence and professionalism.

He was also specific about details and did not hesitate to check into any aspects of the program that he needed to verify, rather than making any errors. 

Further I would like to tell you that he was very personable. It is a pleasure, these days, to speak with someone who can speak clearly and precisely about a specific subject matter, while maintaining a pleasant conversational demeanor.

David,,Santa Rosa ,CA,"Dear Thad ~

Particularly in this day & age, telephone sales has gotta be a rough gig....

Especially with the high degree of competition in the market.

This evening, I had the pleasure of working with James T.  I've been on the phone with many; many alarm companies since I purchased the home earlier this month.  Everyone has a good shtick, but most companies also have a series of poor reviews.

James addressed every one of my concerns - and - he answered each and every one of my questions, providing first the company line, but - more importantly - also providing the information/answer requested.  And he developed empathy and connection with the customer easily and effectively as the adds and up-charges accumulated without being obnoxious, condescending or pushy.

You, Sir, have surpassed your competition through your hiring and training practices - and you have the sale.  Strong work....

Please be sure that you walk James around your Sales Department as soon as possible, to let the rest of your team know that this, indeed, is how it's done.

Call me at any time if I can provide any additional information.  You have my cell phone number.

All the Best - 
=)

She never pressured me and was always there to assist me with any question I presented her.  I was amazed at her command of the products and services your company provides.

Rodney,,Flint,MI,"I've been exploring options for home security for quite some time.  I have great homeowner's insurance and, honestly, have little regard for most of my material possessions (at least the ones thieves would be interested in).  What I'm most concerned about are my 2 dogs.  Recently, some of the break-ins I've heard about involve killing the homeowner's dogs to quiet the barking.  I could handle theft; the senseless killing of my pets, however, would profoundly trouble me, especially if I had done nothing to prevent intrusion.   I was somewhat apprehensive about describing my concern to Protect America.  Within a few minutes of talking with John, I knew I had no worries.  He sincerely acknowledged my concern and confidently discussed options available for protecting both my home and dogs.  Not a single comment sounded scripted or for the benefit of anyone but me ---and by extension, my dogs.  I sincerely appreciate John's sensitivity and look forward to receiving my security system.",2010-09-16 21:06:37

I have just spent over an hour with Ashley on the live chat function, upgrading the number of sensors in my home so that now I have a completely alarmed home. She was outstanding: courteous, patient, an advocate for my needs, and expressed a genuine concern for my family's well being. These days, online support is everywhere and usually means, low-quality, corner-cutting, merciless staff in far-off locations looking to boost their sales. Ashley reminds me what true service is: caring, consciousness, authentic, and solution-oriented. She does your company proud. She is a foundational reason I will recommend GE Home security to others.
In gratitude,

We had one of our vehicles broken into and we decided to get  an alarm system installed for our home. I researched the various big name companies and compared them to Protect America. I was impressed with what Protect America had to offer so I requested a quote via the web. In less than a minute Jeff called and explained what Protect America was and how they operated. It was very reassuring to know that a stranger was not going to be in our home installing the system. Jeff asked what our needs were and made several recommendations. He very clearly explained why he recommended the different products. Jeff is very knowledgeable and was a pleasure to deal with. He was not like the normal call center people who push products on you whether you need them or not. He told the truth which made us feel more comfortable in our decision .

I was talking to one of your competitors and let me say: You have a 3 year contract with me and they don't.  Your great customer service and fair price beat the heck out of the competition.

I am looking forward to installing my own system.

Thanks again for the excellent customer service.

Steve

Dustin answered the phone and because of his polite, helpfulness and great knowledge of the system,  we discussed what system is best for my needs and how he can help me to get it on my budget,so instead of saying goodbye and continue looking elsewhere  I continued with him.  He also had a lot of patience in helping me to fill out the application. Now, I'm one of your customers. If it was not for his polite and helpfulness, all I would have gotten was the info and that's it. Jennifer came on the phone after to confirm the order and she also had a pleasant voice and was ready to help. My reason for writing this feedback is because people only give feedback on negative and not the positive. When you are great you should be acknowledged.

On the advise of your on-hold announcer I used the chat feature on your website. I was very nicely surprised. your operator was very knowledgeable and friendly. She quickly took care of my issue.

I couldn't be more pleased with not only their good work, but also with Noel and Dennis in customer service.  They are extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  It takes a lot of patience to deal with customers over the phone and help them visualize how to change out a battery or remove a sensor panel, etc.  

So thank you, Thad, for your continuous protection that you provide via the Simon II (which I recently purchased via Noel) and the monitoring of my home/property.  It's the peace of mind I've had since 2005.

Elizabeth,,Suffolk,VA,"I am pleased to write to you today to say how very impressed I was with Toby and his presentation to me over the phone. FIRST, I want to say how delighted I am that your personnel give BOTH their first and last names. Nothing irritates consumers more than being told by someone who already has ALL of their personal information, that they only have to give their first names! Previous to speaking with Toby, I had attempted to speak with ADT, but to no avail. They were overly impressed with their coverage area including Canada, and would not even make an effort to answer my questions. I hung up on them. Vector had been my security company up until now. However, we incurred too many false alarms, and zero customer service. Hence, I went shopping, and found your company and Toby closed the deal. I have some handicapped issues to deal with and he immediately took control and made me feel like not only he cared, but that your company did as well. He created a package I could not refuse. He is an asset of tremendous value to your company. Keep up the good work!!!",2011-03-14 14:51:01

David,,Benton,AR,"Good afternoon!
Wanted to take just a moment and express how pleased I have been with the help and assistance in ordering and installing my new alarm system from Protect America.
I want to point out the extremely excellent customer care I have received from your rep, Daniel. He worked with me Saturday to help me install my alarm system. He was very patient and positive while assisting me. Turns out that my phone system is not compatible with the alarm (I had suspected it might be a problem), but Daniel was very proactive in offering a solution of shipping me out a replacement monitoring panel that works on Broadband.

I have trained customer service for a major wireless telecommunications provider for over 10 years now and it is only once and while that I encounter a rep with as much positive energy, skill, knowledge and great attitude as Daniel has shown. He is truly an asset to your operation and feel lucky that I have gotten him to help me with my new alarm.

I have already recommended your company and alarm system to several friends and family members. My father is ordering himself one for his house within the next week and is looking forward to using your services as well.

Once again, Daniel has been a most positive resource for me, and I commend him, and Protect America, for the excellence I have experienced so far in my first alarm purchase.

Thanks and have a great day!

Dave

I want to take a moment to express my absolute pleasure with Alex, your sales representative.

As a retired Air Force Master Sergeant, I also appreciate your company hiring young veterans and I'll say his experience speaks character to all of us who have served.  Please, take the time to ""personally"" express my complement.  Its important that young people know the impact they make.

I called in to inquire about your security systems and services and Mike was absolutely wonderful. He was extremely patient with me and I had many many questions. I believe I kept him on the phone for over 2 hours and he was most certainly the best sales/customer service person that I have spoken with in any sales/service industry, hands down! I don't take customer service service lightly since I have been an operations manager in the banking industry for over 12 years in a call center, I've seen the good the bad and the ugly over the years. If Mike were in my area, I'd offer him a job on the spot. You definitely have an asset to your company in this associate and I hope you will recognize him because in my opinion he certainly deserves it. He was very knowledgable of the products, service and knew his competitor info well. That coupled with kindness, empathy, patience, a sense of humor when needed and a genuine desire to assist me with my needs, tells me two things. 1. This man deserves a raise. 2. You have a wonderful training program. I applaud you for whatever program you are using if all of your representatives act in this same manner. I ordered the platinum system with  several extra sensors and I cannot wait to receive it. If all of your associates are as pleasant as Mike, I look forward to a very long relationship with your company. I hope the individuals that will be monitoring my security system are equally as efficient as Mike was today, becaue after the service her provided, they've got a lot to live up to.  ;)

I'm sending a HUGE Thank you to Mike and to you Mr. CEO for a job very well done.

Anjuelle,Floyd,Oakland,CA,"Justin was so nice and helpful at a time when we really needed help. Someone stole my husband's wallet. He lost credit cards and his driver license with the address to our home.
We are scheduled to leave within 7 days for vacation and needed to replace our old alarm that was with ADT. ADT sent a representative to our house. He took our information, but he stated ADT's technicians could not install the system until nearly the middle of the month. I was sitting at the computer as all this played out. Immediately, I did a Google search of ""home security systems + ratings.""  A link to Consumer Reports appeared. I clicked on the link and saw that Protect America was rated #1. On calling Protect America, I heard Justin's voice. He was kind, direct and helpful. He calmed all of my fears and concerns about purchasing an alarm system that we would install. Talking with Justin let me know that my husband, who is a surgeon, and I a psychotherapist and author could install this system. The way Justin explained everything made perfect sense. The ADT salesperson was present throughout the entire ordeal and unable to counter anything Justin told us. My husband arrived home and the ADT representative began trying to steer him back to ADT. Once my husband got on the phone and spoke with Justin, my husband too was sold on Protect America. It really helped that Protect America is cheaper and more user friendly than ADT for us. But I want to emphasize that it was Justin W and his calm, kind, direct and comforting manner wherein he answered all our questions, that sold us on Protect America. If everyone at Protect America is as professional and nice as Justin then you have a great company and we will be with you long after the 1st 36 months.
Peace and blessings to Justin and everyone at Protect America.
Sincerely,
Anjuelle ",2011-07-25 20:46:27

Robert,,Glen Ellyn,IL,"Mr. Paschall,
I just wanted to let you know that you have a wonderful employee representing your company, SASHA!
I am a long time ADT customer and due to a possible conflict have been speaking with many security companies for a possible switch. I have spoken with three other companies so far and I have to say that Sasha is the most knowledgeable friendly, funny and professional customer service personnel I have dealt with. I would say she is the best certainly in the security industry, but also one of the best customer service/sales persons I have ever dealt with. She is such a pleasure, that I may want to hire her someday down the road for one of my companies! (Don't worry I am working on a new start up, which will not be ready for a while!) Now if that is not a great testimonial, I don't know what is!
You should be proud to have Sasha represent your company as she is doing a wonderful job for you.
She also spoke very highly of your company as a whole, which is excellent to hear, so congratulations to you for putting it all together.
I am sure you take good care of your employees as it shows, but I wanted you to know you have an excellent representative in Sasha!
If I will replace my security system, I will be calling Sasha to do so!

Thank you and Happy Thanksgiving!
Best Regards
Bob

Tomas,,Carrboro,NC,"Dear Thad,

I have purchased a new home security system for our new home and my wife who is pregnant with our first child. Since I travel to EU for business as a director of research for a pharmaceutical company, both I and my wife wanted to have a security system that would make her feel safe in our home while I am away. We have received an outstanding service from Thomas during the purchase of the equipment and we feel we have achieved that objective. Working with Thomas on this purchase was a very refreshing experience. Thomas was very knowledgeable about all aspects of your product and is a gifted salesperson who naturally connects with a customer in a genuine way. His professional and respectful demeanor was in contract with pushy and less informed representatives from FrontPoint. We feel good spending our dollars in a business that takes pride in being the best they can be as exemplified here by Thomas. Thank you for a great experience and congratulations on building such a great company.

Best, Tomas and Liz

Jason was very patient, very well spoken, very knowledgeable, and went above and beyond his requirements for my call.  I really felt the need to let this be known so that his expert service doesn't go unrecognized.  I once filled a role similar to Jason and know that it is a thankless job and without kudos it is hard to be motivated to maintain a high level of service.  Please make sure he knows that his contributions to PA is appreciated.  Hopefully more of your customers do the same for him and anyone else on the PA team like him.

LanaAnn,,Boynton Beach,FL,"I have to say that Mr. Troy is indeed a HUGE asset to have working for you. In all 3 of my moves since I have been a PA customer, re-installing my alarm was virtual pain free and the most efficient one yet. I am a single mother of 2 and having this alarm is very important to me. Besides the given safety it assures, it also gives me peace of mind with my children. Both of my children have sleep apnea and severe sleep walking disorders. They have tried to leave the house on numerous occasions and my alarm saved them twice. Tonight, Mr. Troy gave me back my peace of mind with his product knowledge, his patience for I am not that savvy with technology and his unfailing professionalism. I hope this makes it into his employee file. Thank you and God Bless.",2012-01-13 22:18:13

Julio,,Elizabeth,NJ,"
For any customer in desperate need of help, a person like Cesar is just a blessing in the sky. Cesar is a person that cares, that is patient, intelligent, articulate, kind, and so many other qualities that is hard to describe.  Knowing how stressed out I was regarding the alarm system he took the time to guide me step-by-step through both systems, my first floor and my second floor apartments to reconfigure and resolve any and all issues I was having.

This is what makes the difference between Protect America and any other Alarm Security System.  It is this kind of support from people like Cesar.

I will not hesitate to recommend Protect America to any of my neighbors in Florida or here in New Jersey, simply because the quality of support is simply superb.

Thank you Cesar!

Ricardo,,Upland,CA,"To Thad Paschall,

I was originally going to sign up for home security with ADT, after speaking with Alex and reviewing your consumer reviews and feedback, I was beyond convinced that Protect America was the company I wanted to secure my home and family with. I spoke to Alex on Saturday and he was beyond thorough with his explanation of your systems and options. I think what I liked the most about Alex was his ""no-bull"" personality, he was professional, courteous, knowledgeable and did not make me feel like I was being ""sold"" on just any system or unnecessary device. He was very patient and answered all my questions in regards to my desired level of security. I am very satisfied with the package he recommended and am looking forward to a great relationship with Protect America. 

Kind Regards,
Ricardo

Alan,,Miami,FL,"I wanted to let you know how pleased I am with Protect America. I discovered your company 3 months ago  through a Radio Shack e-mail offering me a $250.00 gift card for signing up. I had ADT for almost 30 years and when my system malfunctioned over a year ago they would not repair it and wanted to charge me a large amount of money to replace it. I continued to pay the monthly monitoring fee  for a disconnected system hoping they would attempt to assist me with a new system. They did nothing at all. I now have your GE Simon XT system (for free) and I am very impressed with the technology. I am now paying the same monthly monitoring fee for a system that works great. Your employees are always very professional when I speak to them. Last week,  I received my Radio Shack gift card and I used it to purchase an Apple I phone-4S. I can now monitor my alarm activity on the phone.",2012-05-17 20:24:09

The only thing we knew with certainty was that it would not be with ADT, but that's another story. Hours on the internet looking for the best deal proved to be frustrating as most of the time when I called the different vendors I was usually put off by them, either because the end result was not as advertised or I felt like was talking to some con-man. This was not the case with Alex, as he was very knowledgeable & explained in detail why he would recommend a certain package to me. He was not pushy & didn't use the ""if you buy today blah, blah,blah"" to try to pressure me into an agreement. In short, I felt like he was trying to help me & was not out to get as much out of me as he could. I'll also be changing my son's system to Protect America as soon as his ADT service is over.
