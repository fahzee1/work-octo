I am a nurse, so I work long shifts and I depend on my alarm system to keep my house safe when I am away. I never thought it could happen to me, but while I was at work, in broad daylight, an intruder tried to break into my house. They busted down the back door, but before they could even step foot into my house, the alarm scared them away. I was called immediately at work and the police were dispatched right away. Nothing was taken, and no one was harmed.<br />\r\nThank you Protect America for protecting my home, my belongings, and my family.\"\r\n<br/>", "rep": null, "can_post": true, "experience": null, "display": true, "state": "SC", "department": null, "date_created": "2004-10-22 14:38:33", "email": null}}, {"pk": 2, "model": "testimonials.testimonial", "fields": {"city": "Sparks", "first_name": "Amanda", "last_name": "", "testimonial": "\"Your home is supposed to be your sanctuary. The place you feel the most safe, yet for many victims of domestic violence, it is where you are at greatest risk. Most people need a home security system to keep strangers out. I needed one to keep my ex-husband out. Someone who once lived here, someone who knows the layout of this house better than any stranger trying to break in.  I knew if he got into the house, it could cost me my life, or even worse, my childrens' lives.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nI needed a comprehensive system that left no gaps in protection. I searched online and looked at several home security systems.  When I found Protect America & used their online comparison chart to compare their services & features with those of other companies, it was very clear that Protect America had the best coverage plan for my needs. I purchased the Platinum System because I knew I wouldn't feel comfortable with anything less. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nI placed a call to Protect America and the ordering process was very easy. I particularly liked that my sales representative was very thorough in helping me understand all the areas of my home that could be used to gain access into the home.  Due to severity of my situation, my system was expedited & shipped immediately.  I installed it myself when it arrived the next day and the installation was very easy, especially since their technicians stay on the line with you throughout the entire process, walking you through every step of the way. After the system has been installed they test each sensor & device to ensure proper installation and protection.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nWith Protect America, I feel as safe as I possibly can given my situation. When your life is being threatened I don't think you ever get that feeling of being completely safe at all times, but now I can walk in my door, close it, lock it & engage the alarm system and feel safer than I ever could without their system. Finally, I can sleep again at night knowing I am protected.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nThank you Protect America!\"\r\n<br/>", "rep": null, "can_post": true, "experience": null, "display": true, "state": "NV", "department": null, "date_created": "2005-01-06 14:38:33", "email": null}}, {"pk": 3, "model": "testimonials.testimonial", "fields": {"city": "Quakertown", "first_name": "John", "last_name": "", "testimonial": "\r\n\"I just wanted to drop you a line to let you know how helpful Jason has been in helping me to get our system up and running...Jason has been excellent at walking me through the set up and trouble shooting...My wife is starting to feel secure which in turn makes me happy.

I have been a law enforcement officer for 13 years now and lately there has been a rash of thefts and burglaries that I take reports on everyday. I finally broke down and bought this system. It is everything I could ask for and more. The system is easy to use and I am very impressed that my cat, who likes to jump on everything, has not set off any of our motion sensors. That was one of my biggest fears because I did not want any false alarms. The wireless was very important to me also because I did not want wires drilled everywhere. My window and door sensors are great. They leave enough play room that I could put them anywhere and they never fail. I was worried that the sensor and magnet would have to be right on top of each other to work but they have plenty of play room and never fail. I mounted my window sensors on top of the windows and not on the sliding side part. Your price was what hooked me into buying your product over ADT. I spent the extra money and bought 20 window and door sensors and 2 motion detectors along with the key ring and the portable talking base unit for upstairs.

Someone stole my husband's wallet. He lost credit cards and his driver license with the address to our home.\r\nWe are scheduled to leave within 7 days for vacation and needed to replace our old alarm that was with ADT. ADT sent a representative to our house. He took our information, but he stated ADT's technicians could not install the system until nearly the middle of the month. I was sitting at the computer as all this played out. Immediately, I did a Google search of \"home security systems + ratings.\"  A link to Consumer Reports appeared. I clicked on the link and saw that Protect America was rated #1. On calling Protect America, I heard Justin's voice. He was kind, direct and helpful. He calmed all of my fears and concerns about purchasing an alarm system that we would install. Talking with Justin let me know that my husband, who is a surgeon, and I a psychotherapist and author could install this system. The way Justin explained everything made perfect sense. The ADT salesperson was present throughout the entire ordeal and unable to counter anything Justin told us. My husband arrived home and the ADT representative began trying to steer him back to ADT. Once my husband got on the phone and spoke with Justin, my husband too was sold on Protect America. It really helped that Protect America is cheaper and more user friendly than ADT for us. But I want to emphasize that it was Justin W and his calm, kind, direct and comforting manner wherein he answered all our questions, that sold us on Protect America. If everyone at Protect America is as professional and nice as Justin then you have a great company and we will be with you long after the 1st 36 months.\r\nPeace and blessings to Justin and everyone at Protect America.\r\nSincerely,\r\nAnjuelle ", "rep": null, "can_post": true, "experience": null, "display": true, "state": "CA", "department": null, "date_created": "2011-07-25 20:46:27", "email": null}}, {"pk": 1317, "model": "testimonials.testimonial", "fields": {"city": "Pearl River", "first_name": "Ellen", "last_name": "", "testimonial": "I would like to let you know that Jim was very helpful and professional with his assistance that I needed with my alarm system.
